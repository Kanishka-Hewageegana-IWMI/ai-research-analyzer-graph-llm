The workshop was attended by 81 participants and jointly conducted by IIIT Bhubaneshwar, IWMI, and IEEE GRSS Kolkata Chapter. The primary objective of the workshop was to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge to utilize digital data and tools, especially Earth observation data, for effective agricultural management in the context of climate change and make evidence-based decisions to confront challenges in the food system, urban water pollution, GHG emissions & nexus. The programme encompassed the challenges posed by population growth, climate change and urbanization on the water, food and energy nexus, and the need to address the complexities to achieve sustainable development and mitigate environmental impacts is necessary. Through various sessions, the workshop highlighted concerns about GHG emissions and their mitigation by transitioning to renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, water hyacinth mapping in urban and peri-urban wetlands, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) applications for rice mapping, flood damage assessment, maternal, infant and young children nutrition deficit under extreme weather conditions, agricultural data collection tools and sustainable agriculture practices.
 The CGIARâ€™s Mitigate+: Low-Emission Food Systems Initiative focuses on reducing emissions from the food systems by developing robust science, data, and evidence (among other activities). Another initiative by CGIAR on Resilient Cities generates evidence, technologies, and capacities that help improve urban food systems and secure equitable job and business opportunities, healthy diets for all, human and environmental health, and a reduced carbon footprint. Both initiatives provided resources to support the training workshop to empower students, researchers, scientists, academicians, decision-makers, and policymakers with cutting-edge knowledge and tools to integrate digital data into agricultural management practices. Participants learned about the latest advancements in Earth observation technologies, big data analytics, and digital tools that can help predict and make robust, evidence-based decisions as they confront challenges in the food system, urban water pollution, strategies to reduce GHG emissions, and tackling the nexus challenges. Thus, the workshop was envisioned as a catalyst to empower the agricultural community with digital tools and data, fostering resilience and productivity in the face of climate change.
 The criticality of Earth Observation (EO) data and digital tools in informing agricultural management decisions was rigorously examined and elucidated through a comprehensive program comprising six keynote addresses, nine scholarly lectures and six practical demonstrations, all facilitated by esteemed national (including IIT Guwahati, IIWM, Assam University, OSDMA, SAADRI, and SPARC) and international institutions (such as IWMI, World Bank, and DLR). A pre-event catch up with the participants was held on the first day session as a social ice-breaking session. The discourse was further enriched by an expert panel discussion on the â€˜Role of Digital Tools in Mitigating Climate Change Effects on Agricultureâ€™, an intensive brainstorming session entitled â€˜Data Science and Sustainability Challengeâ€™ and a showcase of research presentation by the participants. These engagements highlighted the practical and innovative usages of EO data for managing agriculture in the context of climatic challenges and emphasized how such strategic applications contribute towards attaining the SDGs.

Remotely sensed ET continues to advance in spatiotemporal resolutions from MODIS to ECOSTRESS to Hydrosat and beyond. These advances enable a new understanding of bio-geo-physical controls and coupled feedback mechanisms between SM and ET reflecting the land cover and land use at field scale (3â€“30 m, daily). Still, the state-of-the-science products have their challenges and limitations, which we detail across data, retrieval algorithms, and applications. We describe the roles of these data in advancing 10 application areas: drought assessment, food security, precision agriculture, soil salinization, wildfire modeling, dust monitoring, flood forecasting, urban water, energy, and ecosystem management, ecohydrology, and biodiversity conservation. We discuss that future scientific advancement should focus on developing open-access, high- resolution (3â€“30 m), sub-daily SM and ET products, enabling the evaluation of hydrological processes at finer scales and revolutionizing the societal applications in data-limited regions of the world, especially the Global South for socio-economic development.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Machine Learning; Ai; Nlp; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning,No Data,remote sensing; soil water content; evapotranspiration; modelling; algorithms; decision making; drought; forecasting,No Data,SDG 6,No Data,No Data,"Huang, J.","Sehgal, V.; Alvarez, L.

Nowhere is this more the case in less-industrialised countries, which largely have agrarian based economies. Applications of digital innovations include faster and more reliable communication, better collection, analysis, and storage of data, enhancing democratic processes and transparency in governance, affordable financial services and can provide the basis for decision support. However, there is a risk that people with less formal education and skills and little resource endowments as well as particular groups of people such as women will be excluded from participating or benefiting from digital innovation, the so-called digital divide. In addition, there is a risk that people, communities, and societies may be disadvantaged or harmed by digital innovation processes. Digital inclusivity within food, land and water systems are approaches in digital innovation need to include the differing needs and resources of men, women, youth, indigenous communities who produce most the worldâ€™s food in smallholder land holdings.

On the basis of this and our wider anecdotal experience we present, a holistic multi-dimensional framework for digital inclusivity. The aim of the digital inclusivity index (and supporting tools) is to provide a resource to guide to transform and change development and application of digital innovations. Specifically, it provides governments, funders, researchers, and development agencies a framework on how to assess, minimise and lessen exclusion from digital innovation. This is achieved through increasing awareness of the characteristics of digital exclusion, recognising the needs of the actors that they target with digital interventions which are more inclusive, making interventions more participatory and mitigating any potential harm that can be caused by digital innovation.

A digital ecosystem is a network of digital technologies, individuals, and organizations working together to achieve developmental goals like poverty reduction, economic growth, and improved healthcare and disaster management. The study highlights how climate-induced events like floods and droughts have driven migration, affecting vulnerable communities, especially women. As indicated in recent study, approximately 2 million people in Pakistan are expected to become climate migrants by 2050 due to climate disasters. The report emphasizes the need for better disaster preparedness and response mechanisms, including the role of digital ecosystems, social media, and early warning systems in building community resilience. However, there are challenges, such as limited access to technology, the Gender Digital Divide, and inadequate government support for displaced populations.
 
 The study also emphasizes the importance of strengthening institutional capacities at both local and provincial levels to effectively manage climate-induced migrations. By improving disaster response mechanisms and integrating digital technology into these processes, officials can better address the needs of affected communities. The report advocates for the development of internal migration policies that can safeguard migrants' rights and provide essential services, including health, education, and shelter, to displaced populations. Furthermore, it underscores the need for global and regional collaboration to better understand climate change impacts and to devise collective solutions that can mitigate the risks of forced migration.
 
 The research methodology employed in this report is robust, involving household surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews (KIIs) with diverse stakeholders. This comprehensive approach provides a rich dataset that captures the lived experiences of those affected by migration and climate change, as well as the potential role that digital tools could play in enhancing their resilience.
 
 Under the CGIAR Initiative on Fragility, Conflict and Migration, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Pakistan conducted a comprehensive research case study in Rahim Yar Khan, a disaster-prone district in Punjab Province of Pakistan. One of the key components of FCM's initiative is Work Package (WP)-3, which focuses on the role of the digital ecosystem in building community resilience during climate-induced migration. The case study in Rahim Yar Khanâ€”southern part of Punjab, a high-risk area for drought and floods, provides insights into climate vulnerabilities.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the â€˜proportion of water bodies with good ambient water qualityâ€™. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring. This paper also presents a brief, non-exhaustive research synthesis of some examples of current technological upgrades or innovations regarding smartphones in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries and how these can assist in objective, comprehensive, and improved data collection, management and reporting. While digital innovations are being rapidly developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting.

The participatory approach engaged diverse stakeholders, particularly women farmers, to address challenges such as poor production and agrobiodiversity, degraded soils, water scarcity, and livelihood insecurity. Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.
 
 Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of â‚¹22,395 to â‚¹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.
 
 Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.
 
 Recommendations emphasize a high potential for scaling successful and validated models through collaborative platforms, aligning with government programs, and establishing robust data frameworks for cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem impact assessment. Continued trials and cross-stakeholder collaboration are essential for refining and scaling these practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable livelihoods, enhanced biodiversity, and climate resilience in tribal and rural communities.

The model is a crucial part of a larger project to develop a digital twin of the river basin. The SWAT+ model simulated streamflow and other important hydrological processes in the LRB, using various data sources such as global gridded rainfall and other weather parameters, soils, landcover datasets, and in-situ discharge measurements from seven locations in South Africa for calibration and validation. The automatic calibration routine IPEAT+, freely available as part of the SWAT+ framework, was used for model calibration. The model was run for 23 years, from 2001 to 2023, with the calibration and validation periods varying for each gauge location. The calibration of the LRB SWAT+ model primarily consists of the discharge data from South Africa with Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique still awaited from the stakeholders. The results showed that the foundational LRB SWAT+ model achieved a good performance in simulating streamflow in the South Africa part of the LRB, with Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.42 to 0.69. Further calibration in other sub-basins and the incorporation of additional reservoir data are expected to improve the overall performance of the LRB SWAT+ model.
 
 The partially calibrated and validated foundational SWAT+ model for the LRB (mainly in the South Africa part of LRB) will be the initial core of a river basin digital twin that is under development. It will integrate seasonal rainfall forecasts to simulate seasonal water availability. The fully calibrated foundational SWAT+ LRB model is expected to be available by the end of this year. It will serve as the basis for several planned applications as part of the LRB DT. The first application will focus on deriving flow patterns in the LRB catchment under unaltered natural conditions. The next application will concentrate on integrating ECMWF seasonal rainfall forecasts to predict water availability at 310 sub-basins and key channel reaches critical for environmental flows in the LRB. An updated version of the SWAT+ LRB foundational model is currently in progress. It aims to enhance the representation of reservoirs and their operations within the SWAT+ model and provide additional calibration sites within different sub-basins.

The impotent issue identified through this survey is the low trend in the use of satellite-based data in information generation. Therefore, to avoid this, and strengthening the geospatial literacy, it is important to develop training programs on the use of Earth observation data. The respondents of this questionnaire survey also expressed the need for such training. On the other hand, it was shown that the use of social media is very low in the dissemination of data and information, so it is timely important to take measures to increase it uses because the majority of people have a high tendency to use social media. As the highest percentage of end-users of CIS are farmers and agricultural sector, successful CIS system can ensure food security through increasing agricultural production. Floods and droughts dominate Zambia's climate-related hazards. Similarly, Diarrhea, Flu epidemics and malaria are major among the diseases and epidemics caused by climatic hazards. One of the most striking findings from the study is the increased focus on forecasting, early warning and mitigation in the providing of flood-related services.

Nonetheless, discrepancies frequently exist between estimated and actual irrigated areas. To address the data gaps in actual irrigation areas within Ethiopia, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing imagery. However, the accuracy of these images under varying climatic and landscape conditions was not fully substantiated. We conducted a comparative analysis between global irrigation map and local irrigated region maps within two distinct watersheds. Field data was gathered to both train and assess by employing random forest supervised classification algorithm. This algorithm was then applied to create accurate irrigation maps using high-resolution Sentinel-1 data for the Bilate and Gumara watersheds. During the irrigation seasons, maps of irrigated regions were produced using time-series imagery. Additionally, we employed maps indicating lands suitable for surface irrigation and applied post-processing techniques to refine the actual irrigated areas. The resulting accuracy was comparably high for both watersheds, with values of 88% and 87%. The kappa coefficients were 0.74 and 0.73, respectively, indicating a very good level of agreement. However, there were significant discrepancies between the global irrigation map and the local irrigated regions map in terms of spatial distribution and the extent of irrigation. This discrepancy necessitates further analysis of both products to decipher the underlying causes of their differences.

Timely, context-specific and reliable climate and water data and information are prerequisites for sound water management decisions that aim to enhance the climate resilience of small-scale agricultural producers. Climate change impacts water by exacerbating scarcity, increasing the frequency and intensity of extremes â€“ droughts and floods â€“ and increasing the interannual variability of rainfall, on which the livelihoods of most rural households in Ethiopia depend. While the climate and water monitoring networks and database systems constitute the basic data infrastructure, institutional practices are equally important, if not more important, to ensure water and climate data are collected, processed and used to support water management decisions at multiple institutional levels.
 A review of current institutional practices in the collection, organization, dissemination and use in decision-making of climate and water data was conducted as part of the project, through which several gaps were identified that need to be addressed to improve the climate resilience of small-scale agricultural producers. They include fragmentation of data, lack of adequate human and institutional capacity, frequent restructuring or reform of institutions, the absence of a well-coordinated knowledge management system and the absence of clear boundaries or linkage mechanisms between federal-level institutions and those operating within the basin or sub-basin levels.
 Three options are proposed in this report that are aimed at strengthening institutional mechanisms for improved collection, organization, sharing and dissemination of climate and water data and decision support tools. Option 1 focuses on substantially strengthening existing data collection, organization and dissemination infrastructure, coupled with fit-for-purpose coordination arrangements among the key government agencies through task forces and working groups. Option 2 focuses on substantially strengthening the multi-level organization structure and scope of the institutional arrangement for the National Framework for Climate Services of Ethiopia (NFCS-E). The scope of climate services needs to be expanded to include water information services, which are underserved in the current structure. The central proposal under Option 3 is to have a dedicated multi-ministerial institution on climate and water data and analytics.
 The options can be considered as stand-alone alternatives. They can also be understood to be stages in a phased transformation of the institutional settings for climate and water data and decision support services. Option 1, being the least disruptive, can be considered the first or starting point. A successful implementation of Option 1 would mean robust climate and water data monitoring networks combined with a strong information and communications technology (ICT) basis. This sets the stage for full-scale implementation of the NFCS-E structure with an expanded scope of water information services. The NFCS-E is coordinated by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (EMI).

New technological developments are improving the ability of the managers of natural resources, to understand and contribute to the way we are developing using and sometime abusing our resources. Through the Digital Twin for management of water resources in the Limpopo River Basin we have an opportunity to integrate available sustainable environmental flows and water resource management technology into an integrated system, that will allow stakeholders of the Limpopo River and surrounding regions to understand, monitor and manage these resources for current and future generations.
 
 Fish are good ecological indicators and have been used for over 100 years by scientists to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions. The development of and use of water resources for agriculture, mining and industry and urban and peri-urban communities has affected the quality, flows and habitat of rivers. Scientists routinely use established biological methods or tools to evaluate the ecological consequences of changes, but these methods are usually reactive and used after impacts occur.
 
 The FISTRAC tool has been developed through the Limpopo River Digital Twin approach to allow stakeholders to use established fish behavioural monitoring methods in real-time to evaluate changes in river condition. The approach includes the integration of radio telemetry tagging and tracking methods with real-time monitoring approaches into an online web-based system. The FISHTRAC tool monitors the behaviour of tagged fish and water quality and flow variables in the real world. This is represented in real time on the Digital Twin systems. If pre-determined abnormalities in fish behaviour is observed and is correlated to changes in river flow or water quality the FISHTRAC Tool automatically evaluates the severity of the behavioural change and as such the environmental variable change, summarizes the information and alerts users to the information in real time.
 
 This tool developed for the Digital Twin has been tested in the Sabie and Crocodile Rivers in southern Africa and shows how new technology can be used to not only monitor ecosystems, but we can consider the biota of these ecosystem and use them to determine the consequence of how we use ecosystems in real to near-real time.

But on-farm verification of sustainable practices is costly, making third-party certification inaccessible to many poor farmers. Digital technologies for tracing agri-food products from farm to fork could help: novel traceability systems, based on blockchain technology, can make data about on-farm practices transparently available to downstream stakeholders, enabling them to verify sustainability claims without external audits. There is limited understanding, however, of how such digital tracing systems fit local needs and capacities in smallholder contexts. Through a grounded theory approach, we explore the potential of digital traceability for sustainability monitoring in a case study in the Ucayali region of Peru. Based on interviews with local cocoa sector stakeholders, we identify two major challenges: first, setting up digital traceability systems requires investments that do not seem justified by corresponding increases in income. And second, relying on farmer-supplied data creates the risk of inaccurate information due to insufficient capacity as well as incentives for providing distorted data. Our findings suggest that strong cooperation along the supply chain is needed to ensure adequate return on farmer-side costs and investments. Focusing on sustainability metrics at the community level, in addition to the farm level, may be promising, as these metrics can be reliably collected by external stakeholders and add value beyond existing third-party certification standards.

Citizen science is said to have a high potential to contribute valuable water quality monitoring data, while at the same time offering a range of qualitative benefits such as generation of a social fabric, environmental education, and improved relationships between citizenry and authorities. The potential of citizen science is elevated by integration with technology, especially smartphones, which allow for easy data capture and information sharing among a range of other powerful features.
 
 As part of the CGIAR Initiative on Digital Innovation, we aimed to test some of the most prominent smartphone applications (apps) to investigate their scalability to developing regions for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 6.3.2 indicator water quality parameters or other key water quality metrics. We used southern Africa as a case study, since it characterises numerous key challenges to citizen science water quality monitoring using smartphones in developing regions. We evaluated five smartphone apps that are plug-and-play, assessing both their quantitative accuracy as well as their qualitative suitability to a southern African context. We found that the Hydrocolor and EyeOnWater apps showed theoretical promise but would not be useful for typical citizen science monitoring of streams, river, and dams from the banks of those water bodies given their requirement for deep water. The MQuantÂ® StripScan App was not useful given that the reference cards required to use the app could not be sourced and that the app did not function to read the MquantÂ® nitrate test strips. The Nutrient App showed some promise but has ceased being supported, illustrating the critical importance of designing and developing tools with sustainable financing and maintenance in mind (as well as the need for funders to support key tools so they remain freely accessible) so that the great efforts that go into research and development are not ultimately wasted. The Aquality app was fairly user friendly, intuitive, and accessible for free via the Play Store and the Apple App Store. The development and support team were helpful and responsive, with ongoing research and development regarding the app showing good potential for upscaled functionality and implementation in the future. However, we found that there were significant qualitative and quantitative issues with the app that should be investigated further and addressed to ensure the app is suitable for global use, especially in the context of developing regions. These included that i) the material requirements for the app (i.e., a reference card mailed directly from Deltares in the Netherlands and HachÂ© nitrate test strips) were difficult to source in South Africa (which is likely to be the case in many other countries), ii) each test carried a significant financial cost (USD 2 - 5 per test), and iii) the guidelines of the app, especially concerning the appropriate lighting requirements, left considerable room for novice user error or lack of standardisation. Concerns over the standardisation and accuracy of the data were supported by the fact that we found little to no correlation between the estimated nitrate concentrations in surface water samples calculated by the app compared to accredited laboratory measurements of the same water samples.
 
 Overall, we suggest that though our data were limited, they provide evidence that the data generated by real citizen scientists using such app around the world need to be carefully validated before they can be trusted. The reality is that doubt over standardisation and validity of results could prove a serious barrier to use of the data for management and policy interventions. More broadly, we identified a need for digital innovations within citizen science to remain human-centric and not become extractive, treating citizen scientists simply as data collection units. The massive potential for a nexus between digital innovation and citizen science will only be realised if we specifically cater towards the human part of the equation and if researchers and developers remain mindful of technicist assumptions about the utility, understandability, and validity of innovative technologies in different contexts.",C.

However, water quality in small reservoirs is often not monitored continuously, with the interlinkages between weather, land, and water remaining No Data. Turbidity is a prime indicator of water quality that can be assessed with remote sensing techniques. Here we modelled turbidity in 34 small reservoirs in central Kenya with Sentinel-2 data from 2017 to 2023 and predicted turbidity outcomes using primary and secondary Earth observation data, and machine learning.

Our results suggest that shortand longer-term turbidity prediction can inform reservoir siting and management.

Therefore, this study performed a binary Random Forest classification on Sentinel-2 images for five consecutive dry seasons between 2015 and 2020. The small reservoirs were then categorized according to landscape positions (upstream, midstream, and downstream) using a flow accumulation process. The classification produced an average overall accuracy of 98% and a root mean square error of 0.087 ha. It also indicated that there are currently 384 small reservoirs in the UER (of surface area between 0.09 and 37 ha), with 20% of them newly constructed between the 2016-17 and 2019-20 seasons. The study revealed that upstream reservoirs have smaller sizes and are likely to dry out during the dry season while downstream reservoirs have larger sizes and retain substantial amounts of water even at the end of the dry season. The results further indicated that about 78% of small reservoirs will maintain an average of 54% of their water surface area by the end of the dry season.

Mekong River Delta crop mapping using a machine learning approach,2022,"Ghosh, Surajit; Wellington, Michael; Holmatov, Bunyod",Vietnam,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/127825,"Agricultural land use and practices have important implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. It is, therefore, important to develop methods of monitoring and quantifying the extent of crop types and cropping practices. A machine learning approach using random forest classification was applied to Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite imagery and satellite-derived phenological statistics to map crop types in the Mekong River Delta, enabling levels of rice intensification to be identified. This initial classification differentiated between broad and prevalent crop types, including perennial tree crops, rice, other vegetation, oil palm and other crops. A two-step classification was used to classify rice seasonality, whereby the areas identified as rice in the initial classification were further classified into single, double, or triple-cropped rice in a subsequent classification with the same input data but different training polygons. Both classifications had an overall accuracy of approximately 96% when cross-validated on test data. Radar bands from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 reflectance bands were important predictors of crop type, perhaps due to their capacity to differentiate between periodically flooded rice fields and perennial tree cover, which were the predominant classes in the Delta. On the other hand, the Start of Season (SoS) and End of Season (EoS) dates were the most important predictors of single, double, or triple-cropped rice, demonstrating the efficacy of the phenological predictors. The accuracy and detail are limited by the availability of reliable training data, especially for tree crops in small-scale orchards.

K.; Sikka, Alok Kumar",Bangladesh,Abstract,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/168948,"The coastal zone of Bangladesh comprises several polders, which are low-lying tracts of land surrounded by embankments to protect against tidal floods and saline water intrusion. They also enhance freshwater availability and aid in improving land productivity. These polders are equipped with sluice gates for water to drain out and intake into the polders. Each sluice has its own catchment area, defined by the elevation and connectivity with canal systems that carry fresh or saline water from surrounding rivers or streams. The sluice gates operation is influenced by in-polder water management for crop cultivation, diurnal tidal dynamics, and the seasonal variations of saline and fresh water in the peripheral river networks. During the dry season, limited flows in the lower Ganges River allow seawater to push inland, causing saltwater intrusion in the peripheral rivers until the rainy season. Community-coordinated sluice gate operations can improve water management, facilitating timely drainage and irrigation, which is essential for high-yielding rice and subsequent dry-season crops. To address these challenges, a multi-variate LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was employed to forecast salinity levels in rivers near 29 sluice gates in a polder near Khulna City in southwest Bangladesh. Utilizing salinity data from July 2011 to December 2022, the models were trained (2011-18) and validated (2018-20) with covariates of discharge, water level, and an upstream reference station. A hierarchical variable additive approach was used to sequentially estimate salinity from upstream to downstream. The NSE was over 0.90 and PBIAS under 5% for all sluice gate locations, confirming accuracy in reconstructing the time series. For forecast testing, the 2020-22 dataset also showed significant confirmation with NSE values over 0.90 and PBIAS under 10%. With readily available input data, the developed salinity forecast model can effectively capture annual and seasonal salinity fluctuations along all sluice gate locations. These forecasting capabilities can potentially identify critical seasonal windows for sluice gate operations, giving the farmers in the polder a 30-day lead time for freshwater intake for irrigation and starting agricultural operations in the aman season.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning,No Data,saltwater intrusion; salinity; polders; coastal areas; machine learning; modelling; sluices,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Behera, Abhijit","Sena, Dipaka Ranjan; Hasib, Md.

Many studies reported a strong correlation between climate variability and extremes and Malaria prevalence, but it is often tricky to evaluate the underlying causing factors. In this context, we analyzed and evaluated the monthly malaria cases with respect to climate variability and extremes over the last 12 years for all the provinces of Senegal. We emphasized our study to elucidate the seasonality of the occurrence of malaria cases and possible and probable underlying socio-economic factors combined with biophysical factors.

The study showed an increase of 0.1â€“11.8% under highly suitable (S1), moderately suitable (S2), and marginally suitable (S3) for sorghum, cowpea, and amaranth growing areas from 2030 to 2070 across all RCPs. In contrast, the total highly suitable area for taro production is projected to decrease by 0.3â€“9.78% across all RCPs. The jack-knife tests of the MaxEnt model performed efficiently, with areas under the curve being more significant than 0.8. The study identified annual precipitation, length of the growing period, and minimum and maximum temperature as variables contributing significantly to model predictions. The developed maps indicate possible changes in the future suitability of NUS within the KZN province. Understanding the future distribution of NUS is useful for developing transformative climate change adaptation strategies that consider future crop distribution. It is recommended to develop regionally differentiated climate-smart agriculture production guidelines matched to spatial and temporal variability in crop suitability.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning,No Data,crop production; underutilized species; spatial distribution; climate change adaptation; food security; nutrition security; sorghum; cowpeas; amaranthus; taro; machine learning; models; forecasting,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Mugiyo, H.","Chimonyo, Vimbayi Grace Petrova; Kunz, R.; Sibanda, M.; Nhamo, L.; Masemola, C.

Whereas over 50% of maize production in the region is produced by smallholder farmers, spatially explicit information on smallholder farm maize production, which is necessary for optimizing productivity, remains scarce due to a lack of appropriate technologies. Maize leaf area index (LAI) is closely related to and influences its canopy physiological processes, which closely relate to its productivity. Hence, understanding maize LAI is critical in assessing maize crop productivity. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery in concert with vegetation indices (VIs) obtained at high spatial resolution provides appropriate technologies for determining maize LAI at a farm scale. Five DJI Matrice 300 UAV images were acquired during the maize growing season, and 57 vegetation indices (VIs) were generated from the derived images. Maize LAI samples were collected across the growing season, a Random Forest (RF) regression ensemble based on UAV spectral data and the collected maize LAI samples was used to estimate maize LAI. The results showed that the optimal stage for estimating maize LAI using UAV-derived VIs in concert with the RF ensemble was during the vegetative stage (V8â€“V10) with an RMSE of 0.15 and an R2 of 0.91 (RRMSE = 8%). The findings also showed that UAV-derived traditional, red edge-based and new VIs could reliably predict maize LAI across the growing season with an R2 of 0.89â€“0.93, an RMSE of 0.15â€“0.65 m2/m2 and an RRMSE of 8.13â€“19.61%. The blue, red edge and NIR sections of the electromagnetic spectrum were critical in predicting maize LAI. Furthermore, combining traditional, red edge-based and new VIs was useful in attaining high LAI estimation accuracies.

Yet one issue that is rarely considered is how the outcomes of restoration initiatives affect different social groups, specifically women, men, and the marginalized. Our study aims to understand the extent of gender and social inclusion in land restoration studies in Ethiopia. Through analyzing 314 peer-reviewed scientific articles on land restoration initiatives and studies for Ethiopia published between 1985 and 2020, we aimed to: i) develop a novel approach that would allow for the semi-automatization of analyzing gender aspects in a large set of scientific documents using machine learning techniques, ii) assessed the current evidence on gender integration in peer-reviewed studies related to RDL, and iii) identified what gender issues are discussed in RDL literature. We employed text mining techniques to analyze the literature for keywords and to classify articles into three main classes: gender blind, gender sensitive, and gender transformative, based on the extent to which gender and social inclusion keywords appeared in the studies. Our analysis showed that gender and social inclusion are rarely considered in landscape restoration studies in Ethiopia, as most studies and interventions are heavily focused on the biophysical and environmental aspects of restoration. Despite an exponential increase in the use of gender and social inclusion keywords after 2005, most of the research (58 percent of articles) remains gender blind.

In recent years, several studies have reported crop yield losses as a result of seasonal climate variability and extreme events, but crop-wise in-depth analysis is lacking. In this context, we performed district-wise statistical and spatial extent analysis for major growing crops using earth observation and agronomic data from the government to estimate crop-wise correlation. Further, regression analysis was performed for major crops, such as maize and groundnut, using satellite-based climate and vegetation data and observed yield data over a 12-year period. Our results suggested that maize and groundnut crops are mainly distributed in all agroecological zones except the Niayes zone and Senegal River valley in terms of cultivated area and harvested crop yield. We found that seasonal rainfall, particularly from May to September, is highly correlated with the yield, and a 10-20% decrease in seasonal rainfall can lead to crop losses. Additionally, the impact of seasonal rainfall may differ across districts due to climate variability, the onset of monsoon, and cropping seasons. We used the best-fit combinations of rainfall and NDVI and machine-learning models to predict crop yield for the upcoming season for major crop growing districts, with an accuracy (R2) ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 and a one-month lag to the harvest period.

A linear relationship is established between the estimated surface area and the corresponding observed water level of the reservoirs. The results indicate that reservoir surface areas were accurately classified with Sentinel-2 images (Kappa above 90.35%) for all dates. Moreover, validation with high-resolution images provided an R2 of 0.99 and a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 3.53%. Smaller reservoirs exhibit significant variations in surface areas over time as compared to larger ones, which are more stable. The relationship between surface area and water level is satisfactory (R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.97) for 14 of the 20 analyzed reservoirs. The remaining six reservoirs are affected by aquatic plant intrusion which leads to an underestimation of the surface area. The high accuracy and operational feasibility of the proposed approach demonstrate that Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning techniques can be recommended for reservoir mapping within the framework of water level monitoring in Burkina Faso.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning,No Data,water levels; water reservoirs; surface water; surface area; satellite imagery; time series analysis; case studies,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Codjia, Audrey Kantz Dossou","Akpoti, Komlavi; DembÃ©lÃ©, Moctar; Yonaba, R.; Fowe, T.; Sankande, S.; Koissi, Modeste G.

"Enhancing the water accounting plus framework to evaluate field-level water use and availability in rice-dominant cropping system and potential for mapping GHG emissions at scale: a case study for the eastern Gangetic Plains, Bihar, India",2024,"Mahapatra, Smaranika; Velpuri, Naga; Schmitter, Petra; Pandey, Shivam; Sikka, Alok",India,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/173094,"Agriculture is a major contributor to total global methane (CH4 ) and Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, accounting for 50% and 60% share, respectively. Rice cultivation accounts for approximately 20% and 10% of the global CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. There is a strong positive correlation between water use in rice cultivation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily because flooded rice creates ideal (anaerobic) conditions for methane-producing bacteria. This study applies the conventional water accounting plus (WA+) framework that uses remotely sensed data products for the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) region to estimate total water use, irrigation water use, and other hydrologic variables. These variables are estimated and assessed for entire cropland areas and selected rice fields across Bihar, India. Results indicated that the conventional WA+ approach ran at monthly time scales and using 250 m spatial resolution data. The results indicate that conventional WA+ was able to capture large-scale variations in water use but failed to capture field-level variations. To address this problem, the WA+ framework was refined to account better for water use in paddy fields. The new framework â€“ Paddy WA+, uses high-resolution remote sensing data (at 30 m), improved runoff, and percolation estimation routines to track water use in the rice paddy fields. This new framework tracks the ponding depth on a daily time step so the amount of water in each rice field is estimated. The next steps include modelling efforts that will correlate the ponding depth with the GHG emissions at the field scale and scaling the emissions based on the empirical relationships between ponding depth and the emissions.

Strengthening anticipatory action through flood forecasting and early warning systems to mitigate flood impacts in Nigeria,2023,"Oke, Adebayo; Amarnath, Giriraj; Okem, Andrew; DembÃ©lÃ©, Moctar",Nigeria,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/139499,"Flood risks are a major concern in Nigeria, due to their consequences on human life and socioeconomic activities of the people. Floods are induced by high rainfall intensity resulting from climate change. Other factors identified as the drivers of the perennial flooding in Nigeria include, poor drainage systems, poor waste management, unregulated urbanization, weak implementation of planning laws and changes in land use without regard to ecological considerations.
 
 Globally, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events have increased since the 1950s. For each 1Â°C of global warming, extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7%. It is estimated that flood risks will expand, with three times as many people exposed to the equivalent of a 100-year flood event by the end of this century. Surface water flows and availability will become more variable between seasons and years. Soil moisture levels will decline in some critical farming areas, challenging rainfed agriculture and increasing irrigation needs.
 
 In Nigeria, more than 2.3 million people were displaced, 363 lost their lives and 16 million were impacted in various ways, in 2012. The economic value of the loss was estimated at over US$16.9 billion. In 2022, another major flood led to the loss of 600 lives and 3.2 million people were affected across 34 of the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.

This is the case for Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). At the same time, intense farming practices (particularly on sloped land), deforestation activities, mining extraction operations, challenges in agriculture water management, and soil erosion all contribute to increased land vulnerability. The purpose of this study was to review how the risks of natural disasters related to flooding, landslides, and soil erosion are assessed, measured, managed, and mitigated in the central highlands of Africa, specifically in Rwanda, Burundi, and the DRC. In this process, the risks and the current status of disaster risk management, early warning systems, soil and land conservation practices, and risk mapping were investigated for the three countries.
 
 The literature review revealed a high risk for landslides, flooding, and soil erosion in the region. Risk maps covered the potential risks and helped identify the vulnerable areas. Most of them vary in spatial data, methods, and classifications. They rely on input data on elevation, slope, rainfall, lithology, soil texture, land use, land cover, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The use of heterogeneous data sets and geographical regions in these risk maps may lead to diverging interpretations of potential risks and â€˜hot spotsâ€™ in spatial terms and the underlying drivers of those risks. None of the risk maps take into account existing population vulnerabilities such as social protection, income levels, or readiness to act in an emergency, such as hospital access in an emergency. Risk maps could be an effective tool for supporting disaster risk management policies and implementations if they are nationally based and built on comprehensive, comparable, and reliable data.
 
 With the rise of climate change-related risks, the need for expended risk mapping is expected to grow. Vegetation cover, deep-rooted vegetation, and soil management practices such as terraces, green barriers, drainage systems for overflows, or similar physical structures are useful land management practices that can reduce risks. Such practices, however, are not in place to the necessary extent in the region. In the case of disaster risk management, although strategies and action plans do exist, the study faced significant constraints in verifying their implementation and therefore, their effectiveness.

However, this has been accompanied by increasing input levels and intensive production practices, raising questions about the economic and environmental sustainability of current cropping systems. A multicriteria integrated assessment is required for wheat farms in the region to understand the scope for cleaner wheat production in the future. Production practices from irrigated wheat fields (nâ€¯=â€¯3928) were evaluated for multiple sustainability indicators, namely yield gap, nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, profitability, and greenhouse gas emissions. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with simulated potential yield (Yp) data to identify the causes of wheat yield gaps in the region. N-use efficiency was estimated by calculating the partial factor productivity of N, profitability was computed based on reported input-output amounts and prices, and greenhouse gas emissions were quantified using the Mitigation Options Tool (MOT). These indicators were subjected to a multicriteria assessment using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under different scenarios (i.e., different weights for different indicators). For each scenario, farmersâ€™ fields were classified as most efficient, efficient, less efficient, and least efficient, and random forest was used to identify the most important management practices governing the field classification. Wheat yield gaps were small (25â€“30â€¯% of Yp or 2.4â€¯t haâˆ’1) and mostly attributed to the technology yield gap (ca. 20â€¯% of Yp or 1.5â€¯t haâˆ’1). Ranking and grouping the farmersâ€™ fields in the scenario with equal weights for all indicators revealed that at least 25â€¯% of the fields had very high greenhouse gas emissions (>1500â€¯kg CO2-eq haâˆ’1) at a productivity level of <â€¯4.5â€¯t haâˆ’1, and that it is possible to produce wheat sustainably without compromising yields in Northwest India, as indicated by the performance of the most efficient fields. Tillage intensity and N application rates can be adjusted for least efficient fields (<10â€¯% least efficient fields adopting zero tillage vs >80â€¯% most efficient fields adopting zero tillage) to achieve an overall objective of higher yield, lower greenhouse gas emissions, more profit and higher N-use efficiency, whereas residue retention and tillage intensity would need to be prioritized for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. For the most efficient fields the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions was always associated with a decline in yield level. The most important management practices governing the field classification included the crop establishment method used for the previous rice crop, the number of tillage operations, residue retention, and the N fertilizer rate for wheat. The study provides a data-driven approach to screen trade-offs between performance indicators and to identify the management practices that can deliver sustainable and cleaner crop production in the future.","Nayak, H.S.",t.sapkota@cgiar.org,Context-dependent agricultural intensification pathways to increase rice production in India.,Interpretable machine learning methods to explain on-farm yield variability of high productivity wheat in Northwest India.,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Nlp; Random Forest,provides a blueprint for future integrated assessments of crop production built upon data-driven methods,sustainable agriculture; tillage; crop management; nitrogen; assessment; greenhouse gas emissions; wheat,"This publication discusses pathways and determinants of sustainable energy use for rice farms in India, focusing on the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance agricultural productivity and resource efficiency.

 The five phases of developing an African Water Quality Program (AWaQ) are explained in the following papers:
 
 1. State of Water Quality Monitoring and Pollution Control in Africa (phase 1-2)
 2. Innovations in Water Quality Monitoring and Management in Africa (phase 3-4) 
 3. A Framework for an African Water Quality Program (AWaQ) (phase 5)
 4. Country Water Quality Profiles
 
 This paper is the second in the above list and documents the greatest innovations in water quality monitoring and management in Africa, and proposes interventions to strengthen Africaâ€™s current water quality monitoring and management efforts. Innovations related to monitoring program design, analytical techniques and instruments, deployment of instrumentation and approaches to water quality monitoring are presented together with their applicability and suitability for implementation in Africa. Similarly, water quality management interventions â€” policy and regulatory mechanisms, catchment-based management, data management and sharing, wastewater reuse and nature-based solutions, among others â€” are examined. The most suitable interventions are proposed for African contexts using criteria such as affordability, scalability and flexibility. 
 
 Key findings of this paper highlight the following:
 
 1. There are numerous innovations within water quality monitoring and management. However, not all of them may be suitable for implementation in resource-constrained environments characteristic of many parts of Africa. For example, statistical analysis and modelling may require large amounts of existing monitoring data currently unavailable in most African countries. Nonetheless, other interventions such as the priority monitoring approach can be beneficial in optimizing resource utilization. Similarly, technological interventions such as multi-parameter sensors for basic water quality variables are now widely available and affordable in the provision of in situ results and lessening the need for laboratory analysis. 
 2. Available and existing traditional methods of water quality monitoring and management offer a good starting point to further strengthen and streamline efforts for increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Currently available laboratory facilities may benefit from instrumentation upgrades and continuous staff training. 
 3. There is scope for community and citizen engagement in the various processes of water resources monitoring and management. There is evidence that this enables success where governments do not have the monitoring capacity or adequate resources.",Patience Mukuyu,IWMI-Publications@cgiar.org,Water pollution from agriculture,On-site sanitation treatment systems that produce energy or fertilizers.,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Nlp; Random Forest; Computer Vision,Supports evidence-based management of water resources.,water quality; monitoring; innovations; technology; policies; regulations; guidelines; standards; laboratory techniques; instrumentation; analytical methods; testing; water resources; catchment areas; transboundary waters; groundwater; contaminants; water pollution; pollution control; parameters; bio-assays; human health; awareness-raising; data management; wastewater treatment; water reuse; nature-based solutions; intervention; community involvement; citizen science; capacity development; training; best practices; sustainable development goals; goal 6 clean water and sanitation; earth observation satellites; sensors,"The publication discusses the state of water quality monitoring and pollution control in Africa, highlighting the challenges posed by agricultural pollution.

Multicriteria based priority mapping: charting agroecological pathways in India,2024,"Kumar, Gopal; Sikka, Alok; Behera, Abhijit; Malaiappan, Sudharsan",India,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/172484,"The report, titled ""Multicriteria-Based Priority Mapping: Charting Agroecological Pathways in India,"" presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at addressing Indiaâ€™s dual challenges of achieving food security and ensuring environmental sustainability. India, with 18% of the global population and access to only 2.4% of the worldâ€™s land and 4% of renewable water resources, faces immense pressure to adopt resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. This study employs a robust multi-criteria decision-making framework, integrating diverse datasets and stakeholder inputs, to guide the prioritization of agroecological interventions.
 
 Two distinct agroecological priority maps were developed in the study. The first map reflects the priorities of Agricultural System Actors and Stakeholders (ASAS), who focus on rainfed, low-productivity zones to minimize risks to food security. The second map incorporates the perspectives of agroecological advocates, who emphasize the restoration of environmentally degraded, high-input agricultural regions. Both maps integrate critical biophysical, climatic, and agricultural factors, including net primary productivity, fertilizer consumption, rainfall patterns, groundwater levels, and aridity indices, among others. These criteria were weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), ensuring alignment with the specific objectives of each stakeholder group.
 
 The studyâ€™s findings highlight high-priority zones for agroecological practices that balance yield improvements and environmental restoration. Approximately 1.5% of agricultural land shows overlap in high-priority class between the two stakeholder groups, indicating consensus on some areas. However, the remaining land reveals significant tradeoffs between food security and environmental sustainability objectives, underscoring the complexity of harmonizing these goals. The maps provide insights into spatial prioritization, identifying key zones for targeted interventions, including regions prone to resource degradation and climate vulnerability.
 
 This report emphasizes the importance of participatory decision-making, dynamic policy formulation, and periodic updates to the agroecological priority maps. It advocates for enhancing stakeholder engagement through wider consultations and workshops, adopting advanced analytical techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and integrating new data layers to improve map precision. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for multilocation trials to validate the findings and tailor agroecological practices to diverse agro-climatic conditions. By aligning regional needs with national and global sustainability goals, the proposed methodology offers a pathway to scale agroecological practices effectively.
 
 The report concludes with recommendations to refine the priority maps, build capacity and awareness among stakeholders, and integrate findings into national policies and resource allocation strategies. These efforts aim to promote sustainable farming systems, ensuring food security for future generations while mitigating environmental degradation and enhancing resilience to climate variability. This pioneering approach to agroecological prioritization provides a replicable model for addressing similar challenges globally, emphasizing the need for contextual adaptation to local conditions.",Gopal Kumar,g.kumar@cgiar.org,Limited stakeholder input in priority mapping and need for enhanced accuracy and inclusivity.,Use of advanced analytical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or machine learning tools.,Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Nlp; Random Forest,"Guides targeted interventions in high-priority areas, focusing on water conservation, soil restoration, and sustainable agricultural practices.",agroecology; food security; stakeholders; decision making,"This publication presents a multicriteria-based priority mapping approach to chart agroecological pathways in India.

Direct seeded rice in Haryana (India) ABY districts: impact and lessons for scaling,2025,"Mutum, Lamnganbi; Mizan, Syed Adil; Bhatpuria, Dhyey; Taneja, Garima; Mitra, Archisman; Gupta, S. K.; Sikka, Alok",India,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/174881,"Rice is a staple crop in India, traditionally cultivated using the Transplanted Puddled Rice (TPR) method. This traditional method, while effective and very popular amongst farmers, is highly labour, water, and energy-intensive, that leads to significant groundwater depletion and higher energy usage in pumping groundwater. In response to these challenges, the Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) method has been introduced as a more sustainable alternative. DSR involves sowing seeds directly into the field, eliminating the need for growing and transplanting seedlings. This method, tested in various field trials, promises to have several benefits, including water savings, reduced labour and production costs, higher economic returns, and lower methane emissions. However, the success in farmer fields when adopted at scale outside trials remains to be analysed critically.
 
 In that context, this study was commissioned through a MoU with National Project Management Unit (NPMU), Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY). ABY, also known as Atal Jal, is a central sector scheme aimed at sustainable groundwater management with community participation. Launched in December 2019, ABY focuses on improving groundwater management in water-stressed areas across seven states, including Haryana. The adoption of DSR in Haryana has been gradual but promising. The area under rice cultivation in the state has increased significantly over the years, with initial efforts to introduce DSR beginning around 2009. The state government has played a crucial role in promoting DSR by offering financial incentives to farmers. In 2022, an incentive of INR 4000 per acre1 was introduced to encourage farmers to adopt DSR. Given its uptake in Haryana, the objective of this study is to assess the socio-economic and environmental benefits of DSR, identify the challenges, and offer recommendations for scaling up this technology in Haryana and other regions.
 
 The study employed a multi-faceted approach including qualitative surveys with stakeholders, focus group discussions, field visits, and a large-scale quantitative survey (sample size is 809) of DSR and TPR farmers across selected districts in Haryana to assess the impact of DSR.

During the rainy season, the river often overflows, inundating surrounding areas and causing widespread crop and infrastructure damages. Factors such as deforestation and climate change exacerbate this natural phenomenon, leading to loss of lives, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure, farmlands, and livelihoods. An innovative insurance solution has been developed to address these challenges, compensating affected communities for losses incurred during flood events. The CGIAR Initiative on Diversification in East and Southern Africa, Ukama-Ustawi (UU), identified the bundling of climate insurance as an innovative climate risk management solution for smallholder farmers in Southern and Eastern Africa. This innovation involved mapping flood-prone agricultural areas near the river, ensuring tailored support for those most vulnerable. The innovation was aimed to mitigate the financial risks associated with recurrent flooding by providing timely insurance payouts to farmers while promoting climate resilience.
 
 The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE Africa) and Professional Insurance Company piloted the Index Based Flood Insurance (IBFI) among smallholder farmers residing along the Magoye River, Mazabuka District, Southern Province, Zambia. IWMI has developed the IBFI concept in South Asia covering India and Bangladesh using an integrated approach of combining flood model and earth observation data to flood proofing among vulnerable populations (Amarnath et al. 2024). A similar concept was scaled out for IBFI product covering three villages at the lower Magoye Catchment and first of its kind in Zambia. To build trust and enhance resilience within affected communities, a robust flood index insurance product that is flexible, transparent, and closely aligned with ground-level realities was developed. It minimizes spatial, temporal as well as design-related basis risks, ensuring payouts accurately reflect actual losses. During the development of the IBFI product, the experts from the Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA), Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Community Development, Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) in co-designing and implementing with the pilot villages.
 
 The IBFI pilot was conducted for the 2024-2025 rainy season in the Mogoye Catchment, Southern Province, Zambia. The product targets 250 households in the Magoye Catchment of Zambia's Southern Province. Coverage focuses on flood risk, measured via in-situ gauges and satellitemonitored flood depth along the Magoye River. Insurance applies to individual pixels along the river, with each participating farmer receiving about K 1786 equivalent to about USD 64 as the sum insured. The 150-day cover period (November 1, 2024 â€“ March 30, 2025) uses a 10-day observation period for flood events. Payouts are tiered based on flood depth percentiles: minor flooding (80th percentile trigger, 25% coverage), moderate (85th percentile, 50% coverage), major (95th percentile, 75% coverage), and catastrophic (99th percentile, 100% coverage).
 
 In summary, the IBFI pilot represents a vital step forward in addressing the twin challenges of climate change and poverty. Its success could herald a transformative approach to flood risk management, offering a lifeline to vulnerable farmers and contributing to sustainable development in the region.

Drought can lead to reduced access to drinking water, lower agricultural productivity, and conflicts over water resources. Flooding causes loss of agricultural production, damages infrastructure, and leads to socio-economic losses. The report aims to develop a guiding framework to create a Combined Drought and Flood Index (CDFI) for monitoring crop-specific agricultural drought and flood conditions. The proposed framework for monitoring crop-specific agriculture drought and flood conditions includes meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological indices. The framework uses remote sensing datasets to monitor drought and flood impacts. The cross-referencing of these indices helps reduce the probability of false alarms during monitoring floods and droughts. It is crucial having a uniform methodology that countries can apply to monitor drought and flood conditions for specific crops.

Irrigated vegetable production interventions in humanitarian emergencies: Mali country deep dive,2024,"Singh, Radhika; Minh, Thai Thi; Schmitter, Petra",Mali,Report,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/173776,"In the context of Mali, a Sahelian country facing challenges of insecurity, political instability, and climate change, irrigated vegetable production (IVP) interventions have the potential to enhance resilience outcomes and reduce the vulnerabilities of households and communities by increasing incomes and improving nutritional outcomes. The recommendations for IVP interventions presented in this document are informed by an understanding of the complex sociopolitical landscape of Mali and address both challenges and opportunities.
 
 For this study, a comprehensive research process was undertaken involving 19 key informant interviews with humanitarian organizations working in the country. These interviews were supplemented with insights from a wide range of secondary sources including journal articles and project reports. A rigorous approach was adopted to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings and recommendations.
 
 The key recommendations presented here have been carefully crafted to improve the design and implementation of IVP interventions undertaken by humanitarian organizations in emergency contexts in Mali. These recommendations align with the SEADS (Standards for Supporting Crop-related Livelihoods in Emergencies) minimum standards and are intended to complement the SEADS guidance on tools, equipment, and other non-seed inputs as well as impact monitoring and evaluation, thus providing an assurance of quality and relevance.
 
 First, it is important to ensure that the design, planning, and implementation of IVP interventions are contextually relevant while being focused on the unique needs of vulnerable communities. Interventions should be designed to address land access issues, especially for women and internally displaced persons. Security levels (safety risks, political instability, and conflict) should be considered when choosing water-lifting technologies, and interventions must be informed by a gender-sensitive approach.
 
 Second, mobilizing resources and investments is crucial to complement funding shortages for IVP interventions. This can involve measures like promoting space-efficient vertical gardening, supporting domestic vegetable production to procure less expensive and more suitable seeds for local conditions, and strengthening IVP value chains by linking farmers with local seed suppliers.
 
 Third, strengthening organizational capacity for resilience and long-term learning is recommended to enhance the delivery of impactful emergency assistance. This includes adopting a systems approach that considers the socioeconomic and environmental context of the intended intervention and sharing findings among humanitarian actors to foster a learning culture.
 
 Finally, improving data and knowledge management is advised for impactful IVP interventions. This could involve housing all groundwater data within an NGO, promoting the ongoing mapping of suitable irrigation technologies, and ensuring that data is freely accessible to all organizations involved in agricultural interventions.
 
 These recommendations offer a roadmap for humanitarian organizations, donors, and policymakers who aim to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of IVP interventions in emergency contexts within Mali.

Despite being actively involved in various stages of production, including seed sowing, harvesting, and postharvesting, women's contributions are often undervalued. They are often regarded as a cheap labor force and are not given meaningful roles in the supply and value chains. One of the primary challenges they face is the lack of access to and ownership of land, which results in limited and unequal access to resources such as credit, services, markets, and information on modern technologies. These disparities hinder women's participation in market systems and further widen gender gaps and digital divides. Studies have shown that Bangladesh has one of the highest gender gaps in mobile internet usage among low and middle-income countries. This study examines the gender digital divide in Bangladesh, focusing on the reasons behind women's exclusion from digital information highways and their limited access to, use of, and benefits from internet-based agriculture and climate-related services and innovations. In addition to a comprehensive review of secondary data, we conducted a needs-based assessment using both quantitative and qualitative indicators in three divisions.

Here, we provide a first study to perform a deep-learning-based approach for instantaneously estimating rice yield using red-green-blue images. During ripening stage and at harvest, over 22,000 digital images were captured vertically downward over the rice canopy from a distance of 0.8 to 0.9 m at 4,820 harvesting plots having the yield of 0.1 to 16.1 tÂ·haâˆ’1 across 6 countries in Africa and Japan. A convolutional neural network applied to these data at harvest predicted 68% variation in yield with a relative root mean square error of 0.22. The developed model successfully detected genotypic difference and impact of agronomic interventions on yield in the independent dataset. The model also demonstrated robustness against the images acquired at different shooting angles up to 30Â° from right angle, diverse light environments, and shooting date during late ripening stage. Even when the resolution of images was reduced (from 0.2 to 3.2 cmÂ·pixelâˆ’1 of ground sampling distance), the model could predict 57% variation in yield, implying that this approach can be scaled by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles.

However, in dry areas of West Africa, negative effects associated with climate change and widespread water scarcity hamper efforts to increase the productivity of irrigated rice. Quantifying rice yields and water productivity and identifying the drivers for the prevailing variability can aid in the targeting and dissemination of appropriate soil, water, and crop management practices. Objective: The main objectives of this research were: (i) to quantify the rice yield gap in representative irrigated systems in dry areas of West Africa, both in wet and dry seasons, and identify factors that can contribute to narrowing the gap, and (ii) to assess the trade-offs or synergies between productivity and resource (water and fertiliser) use efficiency. Methods: We monitored 203 and 192 smallholder farmersâ€™ fields in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, in four contrasting irrigation schemes in Burkina Faso from 2018 to 2020 and assessed key performance indicators (grain yield, water productivity, and nutrient use efficiency). We calculated rice yield gaps (difference between exploitable and actual farmer yields) and identified the drivers of variability of yield and water productivity using machine learning and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature importance. Results: Indicators of productivity and sustainability differed between irrigation schemes and seasons. Rice yield was higher in wet (5.3 Mg haâˆ’ 1 ) than in dry seasons (3.7 Mg haâˆ’ 1 ), while the variability was higher in the dry (CV = 46%) than in the wet seasons (CV = 29%). Also, the yield gap was slightly higher in the dry (36%) than in the wet seasons (31%). While differences in the number of seedlings per hill and the source of seeds were the key drivers of yield variability in wet-season rice, the split of N fertilizer applications, bird control, and the soil dryness index were the most important in dry-season rice. Furthermore, within seasons, high-yielding fields had higher water productivity, and N, P, and K use efficiencies. Conclusion: These findings suggest that rice yields can be increased without trade-offs with water productivity and nutrient use efficiencies. Significance: This is the first study highlighting the season-specificity of determinants of variability of yield and water productivity in irrigated rice in West Africa.

This study examines the yield stability of pearl millet and rice under various management options in West Africa, utilizing both experimental and modeling approaches. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) for pearl millet and rice were calibrated and tested for locally-recommended varieties using LTE data from Niger (pearl millet) and Senegal (rice).

 RIICE (Remote sensing-based Information and Insurance for Crops in Emerging Economies) technology, developed since 2010 by sarmap and the International Rice Research Institute, has proven effective in Southeast Asia for monitoring rice production using satellite data. In Nigeria, rice is a key staple crop, yet reliable data on cultivated area and yield are lacking, limiting the ability to design effective interventions for improving productivity.
 Objective
 This study aims to apply and improve the RIICE approach to provide accurate and up-to-date estimates of rice cultivated area, yield, and yield gaps in Nigeria.
 Methods
 Over 1500 geolocated ground-truth points were collected across Kano, Jigawa, and Benue States during the 2022 and 2023 wet and dry seasons. RIICE technology was used to analyze the temporal signatures of satellite data to detect rice areas and crop season start dates. These outputs, combined with agronomic inputs such as soil characteristics, fertilizer use, and water availability, were fed into a crop model to estimate yields and assess yield gaps.
 Results and conclusion
 In the 2023 wet season, estimated rice cultivation areas were 226,702 ha in Kano, 113,871 ha in Jigawa, and 317,282 ha in Benue, with detection accuracy ranging from 85 to 90 % in Kano and Jigawa and 75â€“85 % in Benue. Yield estimates showed Kano achieving averages of 5.1 t/ha (dry) and 5.0 t/ha (wet) under irrigated system, while Jigawa yielded 3.9 t/ha (dry) and 3.8 t/ha (wet). In Benue, yields averaged 3.5 t/ha, with some areas producing <1.0 t/ha. Yield gaps were significant: 3.0â€“3.2 t/ha in Kano and 4.0â€“4.1 t/ha in Jigawa, highlighting the need for targeted agronomic interventions to bridge these gaps and enhance rice productivity.
 Significance
 The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating remote sensing with ground data and crop models for reliable yield estimation and, consequently, identifying the critical target areas where interventions are the most eventually needed.",A.

This paper aims to provide the status quo of (i) current rice production and its challenges, (ii) selected achievements in rice agronomy research mainly by the Africa Rice Center and its partners, and (iii) perspectives for future research on rice agronomy in SSA. The major problems confronting rice production include low yield in rainfed environments, accounting for 70% of the total rice harvested area. Rainfed rice yields are strongly affected by climate extremes such as water stresses, soil-related constraints, and sub-optimum natural resource management and crop management practices by smallholder farmers including poor water management, and suboptimal use of fertilizers, herbicides, and machineries. For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies.

Estimating nutrient concentrations and uptake in rice grain in sub-Saharan Africa using linear mixed-effects regression,2023,"Rakotoson, T.; Senthilkumar, Kalimuthu; Johnson, J.M.; Ibrahim, A.; Kihara, Job Maguta; Sila, Andrew M.; Saito, Kazuki",No Data,Journal Article,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/132801,"Context or problem
 Quantification of nutrient concentrations in rice grain is essential for evaluating nutrient uptake, use efficiency, and balance to develop fertilizer recommendation guidelines. Accurate estimation of nutrient concentrations without relying on plant laboratory analysis is needed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where farmers do not generally have access to laboratories.
 
 Objective or research question
 The objectives are to 1) examine if the concentrations of macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, B, Cu) in rice grain can be estimated using agro-ecological zones (AEZ), production systems, soil properties, and mineral fertilizer application (N, P, and K) rates as predictor variables, and 2) to identify if nutrient uptakes estimated by best-fitted models with above variables provide improved prediction of actual nutrient uptakes (predicted nutrient concentrations x grain yield) compared to average-based uptakes (average nutrient concentrations in SSA x grain yield).
 
 Methods
 Cross-sectional data from 998 farmersâ€™ fields across 20 countries across 4 AEZs (arid/semi-arid, humid, sub-humid, and highlands) in SSA and 3 different production systems: irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland were used to test hypotheses of nutrient concentration being estimable with a set of predictor variables among above-cited factors using linear mixed-effects regression models.
 
 Results
 All 10 nutrients were reasonably predicted [Nakagawaâ€™s R2 ranging from 0.27 (Ca) to 0.79 (B), and modeling efficiency ranging from 0.178 (Ca) to 0.584 (B)]. However, only the estimation of K and B concentrations was satisfactory with a modeling efficiency superior to 0.5. The country variable contributed more to the variation of concentrations of these nutrients than AEZ and production systems in our best predictive models. There were greater positive relationships (up to 0.18 of difference in correlation coefficient R) between actual nutrient uptakes and model estimation-based uptakes than those between actual nutrient uptakes and average-based uptakes. Nevertheless, only the estimation of B uptake had significant improvement among all nutrients investigated.
 
 Conclusions
 Our findings suggest that with the exception of B associated with high model EF and an improved uptake over the average-based uptake, estimates of the macronutrient and micronutrient uptakes in rice grain can be obtained simply by using average concentrations of each nutrient at the regional scale for SSA.
 
 Implications
 Further investigation of other factors such as the timing of fertilizer applications, rice variety, occurrence of drought periods, and atmospheric CO2 concentration is warranted for improved prediction accuracy of nutrient concentrations.",Justin F.

Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term â€˜agronomic gainâ€™ based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety Ã— agronomic practice Ã— environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.",No Data,k.saito@cgiar.org,"Major challenges to assess agronomic gain include differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain in pilot and scaling stages, unreliable in-person interviews, assessment of some of the KPIs at large scale, and data limitations in different stages.","develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development and introduction of remote-sensing technology and/or mobile devices that can estimate KPIs (e.g., yield, soil health)",Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence,"facilitate developing, evaluating, and scaling new innovations with proposed agronomic gain assessment to achieve their widespread adoption by different end users based on their needs and preferences",oryza sativa; agronomy; productivity; sustainability,"This study presents a definition of agronomic gain and different approaches for its assessment across varying stages.

This study protocol describes the design of new pilot studies aimed at measuring the feasibility (acceptability, adherence, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on the quality of food choice of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam. In each country, 36 adolescents (12â€“18 years) will be randomly allocated into two groups: The intervention group with the full version of FRANI and the control group with the functionality limited to image recognition and dietary assessment. Participants in both groups will have their food choices tracked for four weeks. The control groups will then switch to the full version of FRANI and both groups will be tracked for a further 2 weeks to assess acceptability, adherence, and usability. Analysis of outcomes will be by intent to treat and differences in outcomes between intervention and control group will use Poisson and odds ratio regression models, accounting for repeated measures at individual levels. If deemed feasible, acceptable and usable, FRANI will address gaps in the literature and advance the nutrition field by potentially improving the quality of food choices of adolescent girls in developing countries. This pilot study will also provide insights on the design of a large randomized controlled trial. The functioning and dissemination of FRANI can be an important step towards highly scalable nutrition data collection and healthier food choices for a population at risk of malnutrition.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,measurement; acceptability; artificial intelligence; mobile equipment; dietary guidelines; adolescents; randomized controlled trials; mobile data equipment,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Braga, Bianca C.","Arrieta, Alejandra; Bannerman, Boateng; Doyle, Frank; Koch, Bastien; Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Gelli, Aulo",IFPRI

 Important gaps exist on dietary intake of adolescents in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), partly due to expensive assessment methods and inaccuracy in portion size estimation. Dietary assessment tools leveraging mobile technologies exist but few have been validated in LMICs.
 
 Objective
 We validated FRANI (Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights), a mobile Artificial Intelligence (AI) dietary assessment application in adolescent females aged 12â€“18y (n = 36) in Ghana, against weighed records (WR), and multi-pass 24-hour recalls (24HR).
 
 Methods
 Dietary intake was assessed during three non-consecutive days using FRANI, WRs and 24HRs. Equivalence of nutrient intake was tested using mixed effect models adjusted for repeated measures, by comparing ratios (FRANI/WR and 24HR/WR) with equivalence margins at 10%, 15% and 20% error bounds. Agreement between methods was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).
 
 Results
 Equivalence for FRANI and WR was determined at the 10% bound for energy intake, 15% for five nutrients (iron, zinc, folate, niacin, and vitamin B6), and 20% for protein, calcium, riboflavin, and thiamine intakes. Comparisons between 24HR and WR estimated equivalence at the 20% bound for energy, carbohydrate, fibre, calcium, thiamine and vitamin A intakes. The CCCs by nutrient between FRANI and WR ranged between 0.30 and 0.68, which was similar for CCC between 24HR and WR (ranging between 0.38 and 0.67). Comparisons of food consumption episodes from FRANI and WR found 31% omission and 16% intrusion errors. Omission and intrusion errors were lower when comparing 24HR to WR (21% and 13% respectively).
 
 Conclusions
 FRANI AI-assisted dietary assessment could accurately estimate nutrient intake in adolescent females compared to WR in urban Ghana. FRANI estimates were at least as accurate as those provided through 24HR. Further improvements in food-recognition and portion estimation in FRANI could reduce errors and improve overall nutrient intake estimations.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,adolescence (human); artificial intelligence; diet; nutrient intake; women,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Nutrition, health and food security","Folson, Gloria","Bannerman, Boateng; Atadze, Vicentia; Ador, Gabriel; Kolt, Bastien; McCloske, Peter; Gangupantulu, Rohit; Arrieta, Alejandra; Braga, Bianca C.; Arsenault, Joanne; Kehs, Annalyse; Doyle, Frank; Tran, Lan Mai; Hoang, Nga Thu; Hughes, David; Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Gelli, Aulo",IFPRI

 Adolescent nutrition has faced a policy neglect, partly owing to the gaps in dietary intake data for this age group. The Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights (FRANI) is a smartphone application validated for dietary assessment and to influence users toward healthy food choices.
 
 Objectives
 This study aimed to assess the feasibility (adherence, acceptability, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on food choices and diet quality in female adolescents in Vietnam.
 
 Methods
 Adolescents (N = 36) were randomly selected from a public school and allocated into 2 groups. The control group received smartphones with a version of FRANI limited to dietary assessment, whereas the intervention received smartphones with gamified FRANI. After the first 4 wk, both groups used gamified FRANI for further 2 wk. The primary outcome was the feasibility of using FRANI as measured by adherence (the proportion of completed food records), acceptability and usability (the proportion of participants who considered FRANI acceptable and usable according to answers of a Likert questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included the percentage of meals recorded, the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDDW) and the Eat-Lancet Diet Score (ELDS). Dietary diversity is important for dietary quality, and sustainable healthy diets are important to reduce carbon emissions. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the effect of gamified FRANI on the MDDW and ELDS.
 
 Results
 Adherence to the application was 82% and the percentage of meals recorded was 97%. Acceptability and usability were 97%. MDDW in the intervention group was 1.07 points (95% CI: 0.98, 1.18; Background

A significant limitation of LLMs is their potential to overlook critical, context-specific factors. For example, in formulating food policies, it is vital to consider regional climate and environmental variables that influence water and resource availability. Nonetheless, due to their reliance on word sequencing probabilities from training datasets, LLMs might propose similar policies for distinct regions. Despite these limitations, LLMs offer considerable advantages for rapid policy analysis, particularly when resources are constrained. They serve as quick, accessible, and cost-effective tools for policy research and development, requiring minimal training and infrastructure. In our study, we assessed the efficacy of LLMs in generating policy briefs by inputting an IFPRI discussion paper into three different LLM-based approaches: a standard chatbot without extra data, a Retrieval Augmented Generation model integrating semantic search with LLM, and a custom-developed Brief Generator designed to create policy summaries from AI-analyzed paper structures.

 Our survey data reveal that vegetable production is ubiquitous, with almost all households surveyed (91%) growing at least one vegetable. Indigenous varieties, such as leafy greens (96%) and fresh beans (69%), are widely cultivated across regions, while high-value vegetables like onion (17%) and tomato (19%) show more regional concentration. Over half (53%) of PNG vegetable farmers sell their produce, with farmers located in the nonseasonal highlands agro-ecological area leading in market participation (66%), contributing to an overall commercialization rate of 24% (defined as the share of pro duction sold). However, modern input use, particularly improved seed adoption, significantly lags behind output commercialization in all agroecological zones except the islands survey areas.
 
 The quantitative analysis, using the PNG Rural Household Survey 2023, and the qualitative analysis, drawing from both manual review and LLM-assisted processing of in-depth interview notes, consistently identify poor feeder roads as critical bottlenecks for every stakeholder across PNG's vegetable value chain. Beyond transportation, these interviews repeatedly highlighted persistent seed supply shortages and high seed costs as significant hurdles. Since PNG depends on imported vegetable seeds, several structural and procedural barriers contribute to these shortages. These include potentially arduous quarantine procedures, limited foreign exchange for seed imports, and cumbersome permit processes, often leaving major distributors with insufficient stock.

The framework combines economy-wide sustainability simulation and artificial intelligence-driven multiobjective, multi-SDG policy search and machine learning. The framework can support multi-sector, multi-actor policy deliberation to screen efficient policy portfolios. We demonstrate the utility of the framework for a case study of Egypt by identifying policy portfolios that achieve efficient mixes of poverty and inequality reduction, economic growth, and climate change mitigation. The results show that integrated policy strategies can help achieve sustainable development while balancing adverse economic, social, and political impacts of reforms.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Nlp; Machine Learning; Nlp; Nlp; Machine Learning; Llm; Llm; Nlp; Llm,No Data,policies; economic policies; sustainable development goals; poverty reduction; equality; climate change mitigation; climate change; reforms; poverty alleviation,No Data,No Data,No Data,"Poverty reduction, livelihoods and jobs","Basheer, Mohammed","Nechifor, Victor; Calzadilla, Alvaro; Ringler, Claudia; Hulme, David; Harou, Julien J.",IFPRI

Rethinking the measurement of resilience for food and nutrition security,2024,"Ulimwengu, John M.",No Data,Working Paper,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/163039,"This paper presents a novel framework for assessing resilience in food systems, focusing on three dynamic metrics: return time, magnitude of deviation, and recovery rate. Traditional resilience measures have often relied on static and composite indicators, creating gaps in understanding the complex responses of food systems to shocks. This framework addresses these gaps, providing a more nuanced assessment of resilience in agrifood sectors. It highlights how integrating dynamic metrics enables policymakers to design tailored, sector-specific interventions that enhance resilience. Recognizing the data intensity required for these metrics, the paper indicates how emerging satellite imagery and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) can make data collection both high-frequency and location-specific, at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. These technologies facilitate a scalable approach to resilience measurement, enhancing the accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility of resilience data.

Sample data issues and the realities of producer heterogeneity and markets, including endogeneity, simultaneity, and outliers can affect such parameters. Methods have continued to evolve that may address data issues identified in the earlier literature examining genetically modified (GM) crops impacts especially those of conventional field level surveys. These methods may themselves have limitations, introduce trade-offs, and may not always be successful in addressing such issues. Experimental methods such as randomized control trials have been proposed to address several control treatment data issues, but these may not be suitable for every situation and issue and may be more expensive and complex than conventional field surveys. Furthermore, experimental methods may induce the unfortunate outcome of crowding-out impact assessors from low- and middle-income countries. The continued search for alternatives that help address conventional survey shortcomings remains critical. Previously, existing assessment methods were applied to the impact assessment of insect resistant and herbicide tolerant maize adoption in Honduras in 2008 and 2012. Results from assessments identified endogeneity issues such as self-selection and simultaneity concurrently with influential outliers. Procedures used to address these issues independently showed trade-offs between addressing endogeneity and outliers. Thus, the need to identify methods that address both issues simultaneously, minimizing as much as possible the impact of method trade-offs, continues. We structured this paper as follows. First, we review the literature to delineate data and assessment issues potentially affecting robust performance indicators such as yields and costs differentials. Second, we discuss and apply four types of approaches that can be used to obtain robust performance estimates for yield and cost differentials including: 1) Robust Instrumental Variables, 2) Instrumental Variable Regressions, and 3) Control/Treatment, and 4) Machine Learning methods that are amenable to robust strategies to deal with outliers including Random Forest and a Stacking regression approach that allows for a number of â€œbase learnersâ€ in order to examine the pooled 2008 and 2012 Honduras field surveys.

Coming after two successive years of drought, the scheme aimed at reducing the burden of smallholders who borrow at high rates of interest but remain at the mercy of the â€œweather godâ€ to reap optimal returns. Although this new program filled many gaps in the previous crop insurance interventions, it still could not attract smallholder and marginal farmers to fully subscribe to it. It also faced its own set of challenges. It earned farmersâ€™ wrath because of lack of transparency in crop loss assessments and delayed settlement of claims. The government of India had to make the program voluntary under pressure from farmersâ€™ associations, although it was designed as mandatory for famers seeking institutional credit. This paperâ€™s focus is identifying the reasons for failure of PMFBY in most of the states despite its improved features, and comparing these states with a state where it has been relatively successful. It does this through evidence collected from a field study in Marathwadaâ€”a drought-prone region in western India, with the nationâ€™s highest rate of farmer suicides. It takes learnings from stakeholder interviews in Marathwada to design implementation strategies for PMFBYâ€™s success and win back the confidence of farmers. The state of Karnataka, in contrast to Marathwada, is an outlier among states in India, with a record of successful implementation of the PMFBY program.

The participatory approach engaged diverse stakeholders, particularly women farmers, to address challenges such as poor production and agrobiodiversity, degraded soils, water scarcity, and livelihood insecurity. Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.
 
 Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of â‚¹22,395 to â‚¹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.
 
 Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.
 
 Recommendations emphasize a high potential for scaling successful and validated models through collaborative platforms, aligning with government programs, and establishing robust data frameworks for cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem impact assessment. Continued trials and cross-stakeholder collaboration are essential for refining and scaling these practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable livelihoods, enhanced biodiversity, and climate resilience in tribal and rural communities.

Increased urbanization and urban food demand, as well as increasing per capita income, will lead to greater demand for high-value products, including fruits, vegetables, and animal-sourced foods (Chapters 9 and 10). Modern food value chains have emerged in response to such structural changes in food demand (Chapters 11 and 12). However, undernutrition, food insecurity, and poverty are persistent issues in many developing countries (Chapter 10). Building new equitable and viable agrifood systems will be one of the major issues of agricultural development in the coming decades. This chapter asks what agricultural research should be done, who should do it, and who should pay for it. A major challenging global issue in agricultural development is how to cope with climate change (Chapter 19), which accompanies deteriorating stock of natural resources (Chapter 18) and growing water scarcity (Chapter 20).

Since 2008, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has produced the annual Cropland Data Layer (CDL) with 108 crop types and 26 other land-use types for the CONUS Climate Console at 30 meters spatial resolution. According to Boryan et al., 2011, the See5 decision tree classifier model is trained for each Landsat scene with ground truthing data reported by farmers on what is grown at USDAâ€™s Farm Service Agency Common Land Units (CLU). The overall classification accuracy for main crops (e.g., corn and soybean) ranged from 5% to 95% in 2009. Annual CDL product is available freely at the CropScape web service system. It has been widely used in various agricultural applications and decision-making, such as flood monitoring and crop loss estimation, crop mask extraction for early-season winter wheat identification (Boryan et al., 2019), and land cover change estimation. Some previous researchers studied remote sensing in-season crop mapping using machine learning models. The pixel-level machine learning classification algorithm requires high-quality crop-type ground truth data to integrate corresponding satellite images as training samples to train the machine learning classifier. The quality of these crop labels significantly impacts classification performance because the classifier learns how to distinguish crop types from the labels. This research focuses on producing crop-type maps for Nandi county, Kenya. We surveyed crop typeâ€™s ground truth data in Nandi County that integrates time series Sentinel-2 imagery to construct the training sample dataset.

In our treatment group, where we offered KhetScore loans and insurance, farmers - and especially women - were more likely to be insured and borrow from formal sources without substituting formal for informal loans. Despite increased borrowing, treated households faced less difficulty in repaying loans, suggesting that insured KhetScore loans transferred risk and eased the burden of repayment. Moreover, the treatment enhanced agricultural profitability by increasing revenues during the monsoon season and reducing costs in the dry season. Positive and significant effects are found among both farmers with unconstrained baseline credit access, and quantity rationed farmers, suggesting that KhetScore helps address supply-side credit constraints.

The COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and the ongoing war in Ukraine have all threatened the fabric of our global food systems. But opportunities can be found amid crises, and the worldâ€™s food systems have demonstrated surprising resilience. With new evidence on what works, now is the time to rethink how we address food crises. Better prediction, preparation, and resilience building can make future crises less common and less devastating, and improved responses can contribute to greater food security, better nutrition, and sustainable livelihoods.

This year's report looks at the impacts of greater global integrationâ€”including the movement of goods, investment, people, and knowledgeâ€”and the threat of current antiglobalization pressures. Drawing on recent research, IFPRI researchers and other distinguished food policy experts consider a range of timely topics: How can the global food system deliver food security for all in the face of the radical changes taking place today? What is the role of trade in improving food security, nutrition, and sustainability? How can international investment best contribute to local food security and better food systems in developing countries? Do voluntary and involuntary migration increase or decrease food security in source countries and host countries? What opportunities does greater data availability open up for improving agriculture and food security? How does reform of developed-country farm support policies affect global food security? How can global governance structures better address problems of food security and nutrition? What major trends and events affected food security and nutrition across the globe in 2017? The 2018 Global Food Policy Report also presents data tables and visualizations for several key food policy indicators, including country-level data on hunger, agricultural spending and research investment, and projections for future agricultural production and consumption. In addition to illustrative figures, tables, and a timeline of food policy events in 2017, the report includes the results of a global opinion poll on globalization and the current state of food policy.

These threats are particularly challenging in Tajikistan, the poorest country in the Central Asia region. Despite the fact that migration is prevalent and remittances account for a significant share of GDP, evidence is scarce as to whether the decision to migrate is driven by weather shocks, whether migration is used as mitigating tool against adverse weather shocks, and how much of the loss in welfare is actually mitigated by such migration. This study aims to narrow this knowledge gap by providing evidence based on a unique panel dataset from one of the poorest and agriculturally dependent regions in Tajikistan (Khatlon province), combined with a detailed set of various climate data. In doing so, we apply a novel approach through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify key weather shock variables among a vast set of potential variables associated with outmigration decisions in different districts. Our results show that different types of weather shocks are associated with outmigration decisions in different districts within the province, ranging from rainfall, temperatures, drought, and windspeed in different subperiods throughout the year. Regardless, more abnormal weather is almost universally associated with more outmigration, and outmigration significantly mitigates the potentially adverse effects on household consumption and food/nutrition security in the origin households. However, more abnormal weather in the origin location is also associated with reduced remittances per month per migrant sent to the origin location. Thus, the capacity of migration to mitigate against weather shocks is still limited. Combined with migration policies that increase net earnings during migration, supplementary support to enhance climate resilience in home locations, such as climate-smart agriculture and development of the non-farm sector, remains critical.",Hiroyuki Takeshima,"""ifpri@cgiar.org""",Abnormal weather in origin locations (and reduced livelihood opportunities) may force migrants to take up distress work in destination locations.,Applied LASSO approaches to identify the weather parameters that are most clearly associated with migration decisions in each district in the sample.,Nlp; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Llm; Llm; Computer Vision; Deep Learning,enhances climate resilience; reduces transaction costs of remittance transfers,climate change; shock; migration; extreme weather events; agriculture; food security,"The text discusses the impact of abnormal weather on outmigration patterns and its effects on food and nutrition security in households of origin locations.

Although the report is centered around COVID-19, its lessons are applicable beyond the current crisis. The pandemic, a uniquely wide-ranging challenge that combined features of previous health, economic and food price shocks, reminds us of the breadth of risks and challenges that food systems must continue to withstand into the future. The report argues for a broader conceptualization of resilience that encompasses climate risks as well as the wider range of shocks that threaten progress toward transformed food systems and economies.

Our preferred Abridged Womenâ€™s Empowerment in Nutrition Index (A-WENI) consists of 20 indicators.

Can machine-learning models predict gendered labor statistics using mobile phone and geospatial data?,2024,"Seymour, Greg; Follett, Lendie; Henderson, Heath; Ferguson, Nathaniel",Ghana,Working Paper,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169433,"High-quality data on rural womenâ€™s and menâ€™s labor is imperative for tracking progress on gender equality and womenâ€™s empowerment, and for evaluating development interventions aimed at these outcomes. Yet, there remains a general lack of sex-disaggregated data on unpaid care and domestic work, earnings, employment and entrepreneurship. Researchers are increasingly looking to digital technologies, such as mobile phones, as an emerging data source with significant potential for closing gender data gaps. In this paper, we attempt to use mobile phone data and machine-learning models to predict gendered labor-market indicators for a large sample of mobile phone users in Ghana. Although our models predict mobile phone subscribersâ€™ sex with reasonable accuracy, they predict womenâ€™s and menâ€™s labor-market outcomes only slightly better than random guessing.

By providing real-time and low-cost observations, satellite remote sensing has been widely employed to estimate crop yield across various scales. Most such efforts are based on statistical approaches that require large amounts of ground measurements for model training/calibration, which may be challenging to obtain on a large scale in developing countries that are most food-insecure and climate-vulnerable. In this paper, we develop a generalizable framework that is mechanism-guided and practically parsimonious for crop yield estimation. We then apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (corn and wheat) in two contrasting regions, the US Corn Belt US-CB, and India's Indoâ€“Gangetic plain Wheat Belt IGP-WB, respectively. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLR) model utilizing remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a major input. We compared the performance of MLR to two commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms: artificial neural network and random forest. We found that MLR-SIF has comparable performance to ML algorithms in US-CB, where abundant and high-quality ground measurements of crop yield are routinely available (for model calibration). In IGP-WB, MLR-SIF significantly outperforms ML algorithms. These results demonstrate the potential advantage of MLR-SIF for yield estimation in developing countries where ground truth data is limited in quantity and quality. In addition, high-resolution and crop-specific satellite SIF is crucial for accurate yield estimation. Therefore, harnessing the mechanism-guided MLR-SIF and rapidly growing satellite SIF measurements (with high resolution and crop-specificity) hold promise to enhance food security in developing countries towards more effective responses to food crises, agricultural policies, and more efficient commodity pricing.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Ml; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Llm; Machine Learning; Llm; Machine Learning,No Data,chlorophyll fluorescence; crop yield; developing countries; remote sensing; machine learning,No Data,SDG 1; SDG 2,No Data,"Climate adaptation and mitigation; Poverty reduction, livelihoods and jobs","Kira, Oz","Wen, Jiaming; Han, Jimei; McDonald, Andrew J.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel; Liu, Yanyan; You, Liangzhi; Mueller, Nathaniel D.; Sun, Ying",IFPRI

Our results indicate that, throughout the shrinkage process, potassium remains a key predictor of outputs, while other inputs (land, labor, capital, irrigation, and other fertilizer nutrients) drop out. More important, the cumulative quantity of potassium from both the previous and current years is a consistently more critical determinant of production than the quantity of potassium from the current year alone, demonstrating the potassiumâ€™s significant cumulative effects. These patterns hold at both the district and farm levels across diverse agroecologies and cropping systems.

Yet one issue that is rarely considered is how the outcomes of restoration initiatives affect different social groups, specifically women, men, and the marginalized. Our study aims to understand the extent of gender and social inclusion in land restoration studies in Ethiopia. Through analyzing 314 peer-reviewed scientific articles on land restoration initiatives and studies for Ethiopia published between 1985 and 2020, we aimed to: i) develop a novel approach that would allow for the semi-automatization of analyzing gender aspects in a large set of scientific documents using machine learning techniques, ii) assessed the current evidence on gender integration in peer-reviewed studies related to RDL, and iii) identified what gender issues are discussed in RDL literature. We employed text mining techniques to analyze the literature for keywords and to classify articles into three main classes: gender blind, gender sensitive, and gender transformative, based on the extent to which gender and social inclusion keywords appeared in the studies. Our analysis showed that gender and social inclusion are rarely considered in landscape restoration studies in Ethiopia, as most studies and interventions are heavily focused on the biophysical and environmental aspects of restoration. Despite an exponential increase in the use of gender and social inclusion keywords after 2005, most of the research (58 percent of articles) remains gender blind. The most frequently used related terms remained generic, e.g. community, access, participatory, and tenure. Only 38% of the studies could be classified as gender sensitive to a certain degree, and a strikingly low number of articles (4 percent) â€• which consider the systematic challenges women face â€• could be defined as gender transformative.

About 2.5 billion people depend on these commons for many material and non-material benefits and to support and improve their livelihoods. However, the contribution of the commons to the smallholder farmers and the economy are not very clear. Quantitative analysis of the contribution of ecosystem services will help to develop policies to better support their management and allocate resources to protect them. In this study, we assess the carbon storage and sequestration of the commons in the Thoria watershed, India using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. InVEST is a suite of spatially explicit models for evaluating trade-offs associated with land-use induced ecosystem service changes, developed by the partners of the Natural Capital Project. The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time. Aboveground biomass comprises all living plant material above the soil (e.g., bark, trunks, branches, leaves). The model maps carbon storage densities to LCLU rasters which may include classes such as forest, pasture, or agricultural land. The carbon stocking contents of over a hundred samples are measured in the field among major land cover types. The average of carbon stocking values is used and assigned to designated land cover types. The LCL U map is developed by using a machine learning algorithm with Landsat 7 imageries and ground truth points collected by the local collaborators. The model summarizes results into raster outputs of storage, sequestration, and value, as well as aggregate totals. The ground truth data and remotely sensed data are used to calibrate the parameters of the model inputs. We also perform two scenario analyses: 1) expansion of forest, 2) expansion of agricultural land. The two land-use scenarios are generated using proximity-based approaches where the user determines which land-use type can be converted to, as well as the type of patterns based on proximity of the edge of focal land use.

See it grow: Monitoring the use of stress-tolerant varieties and seed performance,2022,"Wellenstein, Hailey; Kramer, Berber",Kenya,Brief,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/125313,"Farming is an inherently high-risk activity, and farmersâ€™ livelihoods depend on a set of interlinked environmental factors including weather, soil conditions, disease, pests, and more. Unfortunately, globally, many of the risks in agricultural production have been exacerbated by increasingly erratic and extreme weather patterns (Porter et al. 2014). One way to mitigate such climate risk is the use of seed varieties that are bred to be resilient to the types of extreme weather that crops regularly suffer, such as drought (Cacho et al. 2020). Use of such seeds can potentially help reduce insurance premiums to more sustainable levels, as drought-tolerant varieties could help mitigate losses from moderate droughts and thus insurance would only be required to cover farmers for losses associated with more severe droughts. In this project note, we examine to what extent the use of drought-tolerant varieties is associated with improved performance in the context of a crop insurance project in Kenya. We hypothesize that crops grown from drought-tolerant varieties sustain less damage than other varieties. We test this hypothesis and extend our analysis to ask if there are phenological differences between stress-tolerant varieties (STVs) and non-STVs that would affect the period during which insurance coverage is needed. Finally, since both reduced risk exposure and phenological differences could affect insurance payouts, and thereby insurance premiums in the longer run, we examine differences in farmersâ€™ yields and insurance payouts between the two groups.",Berber Kramer,ifpri@cgiar.org,Challenges to deliver genetic gains to smallholder maize farmers,Inclusive Seed Delivery Model leveraging Champion Farmersâ€™ Entrepreneurial Know-How,Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Ml; Machine Learning; Llm; No Data,"findings also hold across our full sample, with self-reported yields",stress; tolerance; drought tolerance; seed; agricultural insurance; crop insurance; risk; seeds; capacity development,This publication explores the Inclusive Seed Delivery Model designed to improve seed systems for smallholder maize farmers in Kenya by leveraging the entrepreneurial skills of champion farmers.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts correlate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyze to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical process-based crop model (APSIM) applied for rice producers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors, and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data.

Data issues in analyzing agri-food trade in BIMSTEC: Challenges and recommendations,2023,"Saroj, Sunil; Roy, Devesh; Kamar, Abul; Pradhan, Mamata",Bangladesh; Bhutan; India; Myanmar; Nepal; Sri Lanka; Thailand,Brief,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/129971,"The focus of research on international trade has recently shifted from industries and countries to firms. Firm heterogeneity is shown to be a determinant of trade at both the intensive margin (increase exports per firm/product) and extensive margins (the number of firms exporting â€“ new products, new partners, new varieties, and new prices). It is now widely accepted that exporting firms are larger, comparatively productive, more skilled, and capital-intensive, and pay higher wages than non-exporting firms.
 The innovations in international trade literature that explains both the emergence as well as levels and the nature of trade flows through value chain integration necessitates examining trade-based exchanges at the highest possible levels of product disaggregation. Developments in trade theory emphasize that it is individual firms not countries that trade and analysis needs to incorporate firm characteristics in decisions and ability for exporting and importing. Firms are the appropriate unit of analysis for trade flows. It helps several paradoxes once the import of firm heterogeneity is understood. Despite the substantive importance of granular level data and the significant level of disaggregated product-level bilateral trade flow data and enhanced computing power that are becoming available, most studies have tended to rely on analysis with high level of aggregation. Recent research on firm heterogeneity in international trade highlights the importance of extensive margins i.e., new products, new partners, new varieties, and cumulative of these i.e., new prices in trade patterns and firms' responses to trade liberalization and other policy changes. However, the high dimensionality of the data and the large number of responses to changes can easily overwhelm researchers. Additionally, bigger data sets may contain more noise, which can mask important systematic patterns.

The purpose of this scoping review is to understand how the incentives offered to farmers motivate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and, ultimately, how and whether they result in measurable outcomes. To this end, this scoping review examines the evidence of nearly 18,000 papers on whether incentive-based programmes lead to the adoption of sustainable practices and their effect on environmental, economic and productivity outcomes. We find that independent of the incentive type, programmes linked to short-term economic benefit have a higher adoption rate than those aimed solely at providing an ecological service. In the long run, one of the strongest motivations for farmers to adopt sustainable practices is perceived benefits for either their farms, the environment or both. Beyond this, the importance of technical assistance and extension services in promoting sustainable practices emerges strongly from this scoping review.

 Among the global and regional articles featured, these focus on key challenges and advancements in nutrition, gender, and health equity. Topics include gender-transformative interventions for adolescents, progress toward global nutrition targets, the links between adolescent pregnancy and anemia, optimal iron supplementation strategies, the applicability of a single child growth standard, and the need for a paradigm shift in anemia assessment. Additionally, discussions highlight shifting power dynamics in global health, inequalities in food environment research, the continuum of child development from conception to early life, and defining healthy diets through a joint FAO-WHO perspective.
 
 Other studies of interest include the latest research on maternal and child healthcare trends and inequality, anemia and micronutrient deficiencies, and malnutrition in children and adolescents, with a focus on Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. These studies examine determinants ranging such as marriage, education, and womenâ€™s empowerment to maternal and child health outcomes. They also explore the intersection of women's work and child nutrition before expanding to broader dietary behaviors and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, providing a comprehensive view of key nutrition and health challenges.

Show me what you eat: Assessing diets remotely through pictures,2021,"Ceballos, Francisco; Hernandez, Manuel A.",Guatemala,Brief,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/142117,"Goal: Using real-time smartphone meal pictures sent by rural or urban households to better monitor and assess the quality of their diets, and provide tailored recommendations to improve them. Detailed information on household and individual dietary intake is crucial for adequate nutritional monitoring and designing interventions to improve diets. Common recall-based methods are generally time consuming, costly, and subject to non-negligible measurement errors and potential biases. In addition, the scope of information that can be obtained in a regular survey is typically limited. Detailed diaries, in turn, are effort- and time-intensive and prone to errors. With increasing mobile penetration in both urban and rural areas, meal pictures can overcome some of these difficulties, providing real-time, detailed food intake information of individuals remotely and at a minimal cost. Moreover, pictures can be obtained over extended periods of time, beyond the standard short spans (i.e. 24-hours) in recall survey questions, with little to no data quality loss. Such rich consumption data can help identify and better understand vulnerabilities and nutritional imbalances â€”including specific macronutrient or micronutrient gaps or excessesâ€”, and open the door for low-cost, individually tailored digital interventions to promote healthier diets. Moreover, crowdsourced data allow to identify locally available, affordable foods rich in specific nutrients consumed by similar households in the area.

Poor diet is associated with major chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases that persist in both developing and developed nations (Popkin, Adair, and Ng 2012). These diseases contribute to high mortality rates worldwide. A public health challenge is how to reduce exposure to chronic diseases through reinforcement of healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns within populations (Gil et al. 2014). Associations between diet and health outcomes have been observed through longitudinal or retrospective case-control studies, and cross-sectional research studies. Dietary patterns involving healthy food consumption habits among individuals are beneficial in the prevention of diet-related health risks. In dietary patterns studies, it was observed that intake of distinct food combinations is more essential than single nutritive substance or foodstuff consumption (Newby and Tucker 2004). Diet quality assessments that consider overall diet and categorize populations by healthy consumption behavior are crucial tools in monitoring changes within a given population.

Moreover, we find that the gender gap in demand for agricultural credit is explained, in part, by differences in empowerment between women and men, suggesting that increasing womenâ€™s empowerment could help bridge gender gaps in credit access and utilization. Using a cluster randomized trial, we assess whether gender sensitization has an effect on womenâ€™s empowerment and demand for credit, but we do not find that gender trainings help shift womenâ€™s empowerment or demand for credit.

Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better-targeted crop modeling activities, thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.",Julian Ramirez-Villegas,j.r.villegas@cgiar.org,Impacts of climate change on crop productivity and adaptation challenges.,Genotype Ã— environment interaction modeling.,Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Ml; Machine Learning; Llm; No Data; Llm; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,providing crop improvement teams with tools and information that can help them make informed decisions,agricultura; agriculture; climate; clima; production; analysis; anÃ¡lisis; producciÃ³n; modelling; crop modelling; cgiar; resources; crops; cultivation; crop production; climate change; climate change adaptation; breeding; plant breeding; crop improvement,This publication discusses CGIAR modeling approaches focusing on resource-constrained scenarios and their role in accelerating crop breeding to address the challenges posed by climate change.,SDG 1; SDG 2; No Data; SDG 8; SDG 9; SDG 12; SDG 13; SDG 14; SDG 15; SDG 17; SDG 5; SDG 10,IRRI,No Data,"RamÃ­rez Villegas, JuliÃ¡n Armando","Molero Milan, Anabel; Alexandrov, Nickolai; Asseng, Senthold; Challinor, Andrew J.; Crossa, JosÃ©; Eeuwijk, Fred A. van; Ghanem, Michel Edmond; Grenier, CÃ©cile; Heinemann, Alexandre B.; Wang, Jiankang; Juliana, Philomin; Kehel, Zakaria; KholovÃ¡, Jana; Koo, Jawoo; Pequeno, Diego Notelo Luz; QuirÃ³z, Roberto; Rebolledo, Maria C.; Sukumaran, Sivakumar; Vadez, Vincent; White, Jeffrey W.; Reynolds, Matthew P.",IFPRI

Understanding whether, how, and why feminisation of agriculture is occurring, and finding ways to properly understand and document this process, requires effective research methodologies capable of producing nuanced data. This article builds on five research projects that set out to deepen narratives of feminisation of agriculture by empirically exploring the dynamics and impacts of diverse processes of feminisationâ€”or masculinisationâ€”of agriculture on gender relations in agriculture and food systems. To contribute to the development of effective research methodologies, the researchers working on these projects associate the insights they have derived in their empirical research with the methodologies they have used. They reflect on how their methodological innovations enabled them to obtain new, or more nuanced, insights into processes of feminisation of agriculture. A first insight is that the definition of â€˜feminisation of agricultureâ€™ is a decisive factor in determining the evidence we produce on the process. Second, the feminisation of agriculture should be understood as a nonlinear continuum. Research methodologies need to be capable of capturing dynamics, complexity, as well as multiple and diverse contextâ€”and timeâ€”specific drivers. Third, bias in data can arise from gender norms which mediate whether women are acknowledged by wider society as farmers in their own right. Such norms may result in significant underestimations of womenâ€™s roles in agriculture.

Bangladeshâ€™s shrimp production and exports have been in steady decline, since peaking in the early 2010â€™s. Most shrimp exports from Bangladesh are used by the food service and niche ethnic markets in Europe.
  The complex nature of shrimp supply chains in Bangladesh, comprised of hundreds of thousands of small polyculture farms and tens of thousands of small traders, make it difficult to implement tracea bility and certification initiatives â€“ now a prerequisite for entry into most supermarket supply chains.
 This report provides an overview of the sector and the challenges it faces, drawing on secondary and survey data, reviews of government reports and academic literature. We also report the findings of an expert consultation conducted to identify key constraints and potential solutions.
 The consensus among industry stakeholders who were part of the expert consultations is that issues related to the supply and quality of shrimp seed and pond management practices represent some of the most pressing, yet relatively simple-to-solve challenges currently faced by the sector. This would serve as the foundation for establishing traceability and certification processes. Previous interventions aimed at upgrading production practices (such as promoting stocking of disease-free shrimp seed) and facilitating disintermediation and transparency in the supply chain (such as by establishing producer groups, shrimp collection centers, and contracts with processors), have met with limited success.

Our results suggest that the cluster interventions had impressive impacts on adoption of better farm management practices. However, these do not appear to translate into significant gains in net profits, perhaps because these interventions are still relatively new. Further, it appears that cluster farmers pay a penalty on account of a shift to more intensive cultivation, represented by a loss in species diversity and lower incomes from fish and vegetables.

Trade-offs and synergies associated with maize leaf stripping within crop-livestock systems in northern Ghana,2021,"Komarek, Adam M.; Rahman, N.A.; Bandyopadhyay, A.; Kizito, Fred; Koo, Jawoo; Addah, W.",Ghana,Journal Article,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/114318,"CONTEXT
 The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa; CONTEXT
 The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa; however, options to increase forage production may entail trade-offs within the farm system that can be challenging to quantify explicitly.
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study examined how maize (Zea mays L.) leaf stripping affected maize and sheep productivity and associated labour requirements, and farm system trade-offs and synergies in four communities in the Northern Region of Ghana.
 
 METHODS
 Maize leaf stripping involved removing almost senesced leaves from maize plants below the cob level at silking. We combined data from three sources: on-farm maize trials with 28 farmers from two seasons (2017 and 2018), on-farm sheep feeding trials where the pasture-based diets of weaner sheep were supplemented with stripped maize leaves fed in pens (conducted in 2019), and farm survey data from 117 households (conducted in 2014), seven of which were in the on-farm maize trials and owned sheep. We examined the trial data using linear mixed-effects models.
 
 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
 Maize leaf stripping had no significant effect on maize grain yield but had a significant positive effect on maize forage protein yield from leaf and stover. Offering maize leaves to weaner sheep had a significant positive effect on average daily liveweight gain, estimated marginal mean was 29.3 g with maize leaves and âˆ’10.9 g without maize leaves. For the maize-sheep systems of the seven households, non-inferential statistics suggested that on average maize leaf stripping reduced total maize grain production by 12% (range âˆ’46 to 38) and increased maize forage protein production from leaf and stover by 90% (range âˆ’16 to 298). Stripping the maize leaves from one hectare of land took an extra 34 h (range 27 to 42) of labour, which was counterbalanced by reduced labour time for grazing as sheep were fed the maize leaves in pens. For the 117 farmers, heterogeneity in maize areas planted and livestock numbers resulted in heterogeneous production and labour effects of maize leaf stripping. Farmers qualitatively described how maize leaf stripping released labour so children could spend more time at school rather than shepherding.
 
 SIGNIFICANCE
 We quantified in northern Ghana how maize leaf stripping altered crop and livestock productivity and associated trade-offs and synergies in the farm system, including labour. Changes in crop management often have implications beyond the crop's field and examining these implications can provide insights into the suitability of alternative farm management options.

Using data from 13 African countries on womenâ€™s representation in subnational political offices as well as survey data on individual political participation, we find, first, that womenâ€™s representation in local office is associated with higher political participation by individual women (but not by men) in this context. Second, using geo-referenced data on shocks, we show that violent conflict shocks in particular lower political participation for everyone, although the effects are stronger for men compared to women in the 12-month frame that we consider here. Third, we find that, when women leaders hold local political office, the negative effects of conflict shocks on political participation are mitigated for women. These analyses offer important new insights into the relationship between womenâ€™s political representation and womenâ€™s individual political activity within the context of shocks.",No Data,ifpri@cgiar.org,"the effects of shocks, especially violent events, on political participation and collective action outcomes are negative in the short term for both men and women",No Data,Machine Learning; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Ml; Machine Learning; Llm; No Data; Llm; Nlp,"enhance voice and agency, particularly among women in Africa South of Sahara",gender; women; women's participation; political systems; conflicts; shock; climate; fragility,"This study explores the relationship between women's representation in local political offices and individual political participation in 13 African countries amidst conflicts and climate shocks.

Moreover, the context-specificity of empowerment implies that a quantitative measure alone will be inadequate to capture the nuances of the empowerment process. The Gender, Agriculture, and Assets Project, Phase 2 (GAAP2), a portfolio of 13 agricultural development projects in nine countries in South Asia and Africa, developed the project-level Womenâ€™s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) and qualitative protocols for impact evaluations. Pro-WEAI covers three major types of agencies: instrumental, intrinsic, and collective. This paper synthesizes the results of 11 mixed-methods evaluations to assess these projectsâ€™ empowerment impacts. The projects implemented the pro-WEAI and its associated qualitative protocols in their impact evaluations. Our synthesis finds mixed, and mostly null impacts on aggregate indicators of womenâ€™s empowerment, with positive impacts more likely in the South Asian, rather than African, cases. There were more significant impacts on instrumental agency indicators and collective agency indicators, reflecting the group-based approaches used. We found few significant impacts on intrinsic agency indicators, except for those projects that intentionally addressed gender norms. Quantitative analysis does not show an association between the types of strategies that projects implemented and their impacts, except for capacity building strategies. This finding reveals the limitations of quantitative analysis, given the small number of projects involved. The qualitative studies provide more nuance and insight: some base level of empowerment and forms of agency may be necessary for women to participate in project activities, to benefit or further increase their empowerment. Our results highlight the need for projects to focus specifically on empowerment, rather than assume that projects aiming to reach and benefit women automatically empower them. Our study also shows the value of both a common metric to compare empowerment impacts across projects and contexts and qualitative work to understand and contextualize these impacts.",Agnes R.
