Nowhere is this more the case in less-industrialised countries, which largely have agrarian based economies. Applications of digital innovations include faster and more reliable communication, better collection, analysis, and storage of data, enhancing democratic processes and transparency in governance, affordable financial services and can provide the basis for decision support. However, there is a risk that people with less formal education and skills and little resource endowments as well as particular groups of people such as women will be excluded from participating or benefiting from digital innovation, the so-called digital divide. In addition, there is a risk that people, communities, and societies may be disadvantaged or harmed by digital innovation processes.

Specifically, it provides governments, funders, researchers, and development agencies a framework on how to assess, minimise and lessen exclusion from digital innovation. This is achieved through increasing awareness of the characteristics of digital exclusion, recognising the needs of the actors that they target with digital interventions which are more inclusive, making interventions more participatory and mitigating any potential harm that can be caused by digital innovation.

A digital ecosystem is a network of digital technologies, individuals, and organizations working together to achieve developmental goals like poverty reduction, economic growth, and improved healthcare and disaster management. The study highlights how climate-induced events like floods and droughts have driven migration, affecting vulnerable communities, especially women. As indicated in recent study, approximately 2 million people in Pakistan are expected to become climate migrants by 2050 due to climate disasters. The report emphasizes the need for better disaster preparedness and response mechanisms, including the role of digital ecosystems, social media, and early warning systems in building community resilience. However, there are challenges, such as limited access to technology, the Gender Digital Divide, and inadequate government support for displaced populations.
 
 The study also emphasizes the importance of strengthening institutional capacities at both local and provincial levels to effectively manage climate-induced migrations. By improving disaster response mechanisms and integrating digital technology into these processes, officials can better address the needs of affected communities. The report advocates for the development of internal migration policies that can safeguard migrants' rights and provide essential services, including health, education, and shelter, to displaced populations. Furthermore, it underscores the need for global and regional collaboration to better understand climate change impacts and to devise collective solutions that can mitigate the risks of forced migration.
 
 The research methodology employed in this report is robust, involving household surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews (KIIs) with diverse stakeholders. This comprehensive approach provides a rich dataset that captures the lived experiences of those affected by migration and climate change, as well as the potential role that digital tools could play in enhancing their resilience.

The effective and efficient water resource conservation and management necessary to mitigate the crisis requires monitoring data, especially on water quality. This is recognized by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, particularly indicator 6.3.2., which requires all UN member states to measure and report the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœproportion of water bodies with good ambient water qualityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. However, gathering sufficient data on water quality is reliant on data collection at spatial and temporal scales that are generally outside the capacity of institutions using conventional methods. Digital technologies, such as wireless sensor networks and remote sensing, have come to the fore as promising avenues to increase the scope of data collection and reporting. Citizen science (which goes by many names, e.g., participatory science or community-based monitoring) has also been earmarked as a powerful mechanism to improve monitoring. However, both avenues have drawbacks and limitations. The synergy between the strengths of modern technologies and citizen science presents an opportunity to use the best features of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the other. This paper briefly synthesizes recent research illustrating how smartphones, sometimes in conjunction with other sensors, present a nexus point method for citizen scientists to engage with and use sophisticated modern technology for water quality monitoring.

While digital innovations are being rapiDLy developed worldwide, there remains a paucity of scientific and socioeconomic validation of their suitability and usefulness within citizen science. This perhaps contributes to the fact that the uptake and upscaling of smartphone-assisted citizen science continues to underperform compared to its potential within water resource management and SDG reporting.

The participatory approach engaged diverse stakeholders, particularly women farmers, to address challenges such as poor production and agrobiodiversity, degraded soils, water scarcity, and livelihood insecurity. Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.
 
 Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of Ã¢â€šÂ¹22,395 to Ã¢â€šÂ¹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.
 
 Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.
 
 Recommendations emphasize a high potential for scaling successful and validated models through collaborative platforms, aligning with government programs, and establishing robust data frameworks for cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem impact assessment. Continued trials and cross-stakeholder collaboration are essential for refining and scaling these practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable livelihoods, enhanced biodiversity, and climate resilience in tribal and rural communities.

The SWAT+ model simulated streamflow and other important hydrological processes in the LRB, using various data sources such as global gridded rainfall and other weather parameters, soils, landcover datasets, and in-situ discharge measurements from seven locations in South Africa for calibration and validation. The automatic calibration routine IPEAT+, freely available as part of the SWAT+ framework, was used for model calibration. The model was run for 23 years, from 2001 to 2023, with the calibration and validation periods varying for each gauge location. The calibration of the LRB SWAT+ model primarily consists of the discharge data from South Africa with Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique still awaited from the stakeholders. The results showed that the foundational LRB SWAT+ model achieved a good performance in simulating streamflow in the South Africa part of the LRB, with Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.42 to 0.69. Further calibration in other sub-basins and the incorporation of additional reservoir data are expected to improve the overall performance of the LRB SWAT+ model.
 
 The partially calibrated and validated foundational SWAT+ model for the LRB (mainly in the South Africa part of LRB) will be the initial core of a river basin digital twin that is under development. It will integrate seasonal rainfall forecasts to simulate seasonal water availability. The fully calibrated foundational SWAT+ LRB model is expected to be available by the end of this year. It will serve as the basis for several planned applications as part of the LRB DT. The first application will focus on deriving flow patterns in the LRB catchment under unaltered natural conditions. The next application will concentrate on integrating ECMWF seasonal rainfall forecasts to predict water availability at 310 sub-basins and key channel reaches critical for environmental flows in the LRB. An updated version of the SWAT+ LRB foundational model is currently in progress. It aims to enhance the representation of reservoirs and their operations within the SWAT+ model and provide additional calibration sites within different sub-basins. This model will act as a baseline to create multiple planned applications co-developed with stakeholders.",Climate Change Impacts on Water Availability and Use in the Limpopo River Basin.,The study developed a foundational LRB hydrological model using SWAT+ to serve as a basis for future applications.,Including reservoir operations and additional calibration sites will improve the model simulation appreciably and make it an ideal candidate for various river basin management applications.,hydrological modelling;river basins;soil;water resources;rainfall;climate change;forecasting;transboundary waters;stream flow;discharge;riparian zones;stakeholders,"This publication discusses the impacts of climate change on water availability and usage in the Limpopo River Basin, providing insights into how climate change affects water resources in this region.",https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/151939

The impotent issue identified through this survey is the low trend in the use of satellite-based data in information generation. Therefore, to avoid this, and strengthening the geospatial literacy, it is important to develop training programs on the use of Earth observation data. The respondents of this questionnaire survey also expressed the need for such training. On the other hand, it was shown that the use of social media is very low in the dissemination of data and information, so it is timely important to take measures to increase it uses because the majority of people have a high tendency to use social media. As the highest percentage of end-users of CIS are farmers and agricultural sector, successful CIS system can ensure food security through increasing agricultural production. Floods and droughts dominate Zambia's climate-related hazards. Similarly, Diarrhea, Flu epidemics and malaria are major among the diseases and epidemics caused by climatic hazards. One of the most striking findings from the study is the increased focus on forecasting, early warning and mitigation in the providing of flood-related services. Even in the provision of drought-related services, considerable attention has been paid to warning and mitigation. However, it is noteworthy that monitoring and mapping based on satellite data is low in both flood and drought disasters. According to the perception of the respondent, more than 97% of the respondents to the study expressed their willingness to collaborate with the Accelerating the Impact of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (aiCCRA) initiative on procuring any of the CIS.

This potential is particularly pronounced in less industrialised, agrarian-based economies. Digital advancements promise enhanced communication, improved data management, democratic and transparent governance, accessible financial services, and decision-making support. Nevertheless, there are rising concerns about the risk of digital innovation bypassing individuals with scant education, scarce resources, native populations, and susceptible demographics such as women and young people, thus depriving them of its advantages. Additionally, the potential harms of digital technologies to these populations and society are worth considerable attention. This article addresses the concept of digital inclusivity within food, land, and water systems, emphasising the diverse needs of various groups, particularly those managing smallholder land holdings. We present evidence from peer-reviewed literature and other sources supporting the need for inclusive digital innovation. We introduce a comprehensive five-dimensional framework CAUSE (Consequences, Accessibility, Usefulness, Support, Enabling) with twenty-two indicators to foster digital inclusivity. Building on this framework, we propose a 'Digital Inclusivity Index' encompassing these multidimensional aspects. The paper argues for a broader 'digital ecosystem' perspective, where collaborative knowledge and resource sharing enhance digital innovation, extending beyond mere technology adoption to include shifts in existing social structures and institutions. Thus, the CAUSE framework helps in enabling wider access to digital innovation and has the useful consequence of increased support for its practical applications, enhancing its overall usefulness to society.",No Data,No Data,No Data,digital technology;resources;inclusion;systems,"This publication outlines the development of a comprehensive multi-directional framework aimed at promoting digital inclusivity in less industrialised countries.

Nonetheless, discrepancies frequently exist between estimated and actual irrigated areas. To address the data gaps in actual irrigation areas within Ethiopia, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing imagery. However, the accuracy of these images under varying climatic and landscape conditions was not fully substantiated. We conducted a comparative analysis between global irrigation map and local irrigated region maps within two distinct watersheds. Field data was gathered to both train and assess by employing random forest supervised classification algorithm. This algorithm was then applied to create accurate irrigation maps using high-resolution Sentinel-1 data for the Bilate and Gumara watersheds. During the irrigation seasons, maps of irrigated regions were produced using time-series imagery. Additionally, we employed maps indicating lands suitable for surface irrigation and applied post-processing techniques to refine the actual irrigated areas. The resulting accuracy was comparably high for both watersheds, with values of 88% and 87%. The kappa coefficients were 0.74 and 0.73, respectively, indicating a very good level of agreement. However, there were significant discrepancies between the global irrigation map and the local irrigated regions map in terms of spatial distribution and the extent of irrigation. This discrepancy necessitates further analysis of both products to decipher the underlying causes of their differences. We recommend for additional studies encompassing diverse watershed characteristics to improve irrigation area mapping via remote sensing.

Timely, context-specific and reliable climate and water data and information are prerequisites for sound water management decisions that aim to enhance the climate resilience of small-scale agricultural producers. Climate change impacts water by exacerbating scarcity, increasing the frequency and intensity of extremes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ droughts and floods Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and increasing the interannual variability of rainfall, on which the livelihoods of most rural households in Ethiopia depend. While the climate and water monitoring networks and database systems constitute the basic data infrastructure, institutional practices are equally important, if not more important, to ensure water and climate data are collected, processed and used to support water management decisions at multiple institutional levels.
 A review of current institutional practices in the collection, organization, dissemination and use in decision-making of climate and water data was conducted as part of the project, through which several gaps were identified that need to be addressed to improve the climate resilience of small-scale agricultural producers. They include fragmentation of data, lack of adequate human and institutional capacity, frequent restructuring or reform of institutions, the absence of a well-coordinated knowledge management system and the absence of clear boundaries or linkage mechanisms between federal-level institutions and those operating within the basin or sub-basin levels.
 Three options are proposed in this report that are aimed at strengthening institutional mechanisms for improved collection, organization, sharing and dissemination of climate and water data and decision support tools. Option 1 focuses on substantially strengthening existing data collection, organization and dissemination infrastructure, coupled with fit-for-purpose coordination arrangements among the key government agencies through task forces and working groups. Option 2 focuses on substantially strengthening the multi-level organization structure and scope of the institutional arrangement for the National Framework for Climate Services of Ethiopia (NFCS-E). The scope of climate services needs to be expanded to include water information services, which are underserved in the current structure. The central proposal under Option 3 is to have a dedicated multi-ministerial institution on climate and water data and analytics.
 The options can be considered as stand-alone alternatives. They can also be understood to be stages in a phased transformation of the institutional settings for climate and water data and decision support services. Option 1, being the least disruptive, can be considered the first or starting point. A successful implementation of Option 1 would mean robust climate and water data monitoring networks combined with a strong information and communications technology (ICT) basis. This sets the stage for full-scale implementation of the NFCS-E structure with an expanded scope of water information services. The NFCS-E is coordinated by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (EMI). In Option 3, a fully dedicated climate and water data and analytics center is proposed.

New technological developments are improving the ability of the managers of natural resources, to understand and contribute to the way we are developing using and sometime abusing our resources. Through the Digital Twin for management of water resources in the Limpopo River Basin we have an opportunity to integrate available sustainable environmental flows and water resource management technology into an integrated system, that will allow stakeholders of the Limpopo River and surrounding regions to understand, monitor and manage these resources for current and future generations.
 
 Fish are good ecological indicators and have been used for over 100 years by scientists to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions. The development of and use of water resources for agriculture, mining and industry and urban and peri-urban communities has affected the quality, flows and habitat of rivers. Scientists routinely use established biological methods or tools to evaluate the ecological consequences of changes, but these methods are usually reactive and used after impacts occur.
 
 The FISTRAC tool has been developed through the Limpopo River Digital Twin approach to allow stakeholders to use established fish behavioural monitoring methods in real-time to evaluate changes in river condition. The approach includes the integration of radio telemetry tagging and tracking methods with real-time monitoring approaches into an online web-based system. The FISHTRAC tool monitors the behaviour of tagged fish and water quality and flow variables in the real world. This is represented in real time on the Digital Twin systems. If pre-determined abnormalities in fish behaviour is observed and is correlated to changes in river flow or water quality the FISHTRAC Tool automatically evaluates the severity of the behavioural change and as such the environmental variable change, summarizes the information and alerts users to the information in real time.
 
 This tool developed for the Digital Twin has been tested in the Sabie and Crocodile Rivers in southern Africa and shows how new technology can be used to not only monitor ecosystems, but we can consider the biota of these ecosystem and use them to determine the consequence of how we use ecosystems in real to near-real time. The FISHTRAC tool has the potential to make a considerable contribution to the sustainable water resources in southern Africa through the Digital Twin system.","Some challenges to address are consistency, signal is not always available at the study areas, leading to times of blackout, where the data is still being collected however it can't make the transfer.",FISHTRAC dashboard,integration of simplicity within scientific procedures,fish tracking;monitoring;river basins;water quality;stream flow,"The document outlines the FISHTRAC dashboard, which serves as a tool for accessing data related to tagged fish and abiotic probes.

But on-farm verification of sustainable practices is costly, making third-party certification inaccessible to many poor farmers. Digital technologies for tracing agri-food products from farm to fork could help: novel traceability systems, based on blockchain technology, can make data about on-farm practices transparently available to downstream stakeholders, enabling them to verify sustainability claims without external audits. There is limited understanding, however, of how such digital tracing systems fit local needs and capacities in smallholder contexts. Through a grounded theory approach, we explore the potential of digital traceability for sustainability monitoring in a case study in the Ucayali region of Peru. Based on interviews with local cocoa sector stakeholders, we identify two major challenges: first, setting up digital traceability systems requires investments that do not seem justified by corresponding increases in income. And second, relying on farmer-supplied data creates the risk of inaccurate information due to insufficient capacity as well as incentives for providing distorted data. Our findings suggest that strong cooperation along the supply chain is needed to ensure adequate return on farmer-side costs and investments. Focusing on sustainability metrics at the community level, in addition to the farm level, may be promising, as these metrics can be reliably collected by external stakeholders and add value beyond existing third-party certification standards.

Citizen science is said to have a high potential to contribute valuable water quality monitoring data, while at the same time offering a range of qualitative benefits such as generation of a social fabric, environmental education, and improved relationships between citizenry and authorities. The potential of citizen science is elevated by integration with technology, especially smartphones, which allow for easy data capture and information sharing among a range of other powerful features.
 
 As part of the CGIAR Initiative on Digital Innovation, we aimed to test some of the most prominent smartphone applications (apps) to investigate their scalability to developing regions for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 6.3.2 indicator water quality parameters or other key water quality metrics. We used southern Africa as a case study, since it characterises numerous key challenges to citizen science water quality monitoring using smartphones in developing regions. We evaluated five smartphone apps that are plug-and-play, assessing both their quantitative accuracy as well as their qualitative suitability to a southern African context. We found that the Hydrocolor and EyeOnWater apps showed theoretical promise but would not be useful for typical citizen science monitoring of streams, river, and dams from the banks of those water bodies given their requirement for deep water. The MQuantÃ‚Â® StripScan App was not useful given that the reference cards required to use the app could not be sourced and that the app did not function to read the MquantÃ‚Â® nitrate test strips. The Nutrient App showed some promise but has ceased being supported, illustrating the critical importance of designing and developing tools with sustainable financing and maintenance in mind (as well as the need for funders to support key tools so they remain freely accessible) so that the great efforts that go into research and development are not ultimately wasted. The Aquality app was fairly user frienDLy, intuitive, and accessible for free via the Play Store and the Apple App Store. The development and support team were helpful and responsive, with ongoing research and development regarding the app showing good potential for upscaled functionality and implementation in the future. However, we found that there were significant qualitative and quantitative issues with the app that should be investigated further and addressed to ensure the app is suitable for global use, especially in the context of developing regions. These included that i) the material requirements for the app (i.e., a reference card mailed directly from Deltares in the Netherlands and HachÃ‚Â© nitrate test strips) were difficult to source in South Africa (which is likely to be the case in many other countries), ii) each test carried a significant financial cost (USD 2 - 5 per test), and iii) the guidelines of the app, especially concerning the appropriate lighting requirements, left considerable room for novice user error or lack of standardisation. Concerns over the standardisation and accuracy of the data were supported by the fact that we found little to no correlation between the estimated nitrate concentrations in surface water samples calculated by the app compared to accredited laboratory measurements of the same water samples.
 
 Overall, we suggest that though our data were limited, they provide evidence that the data generated by real citizen scientists using such app around the world need to be carefully validated before they can be trusted. The reality is that doubt over standardisation and validity of results could prove a serious barrier to use of the data for management and policy interventions. More broaDLy, we identified a need for digital innovations within citizen science to remain human-centric and not become extractive, treating citizen scientists simply as data collection units. The massive potential for a nexus between digital innovation and citizen science will only be realised if we specifically cater towards the human part of the equation and if researchers and developers remain mindful of technicist assumptions about the utility, understandability, and validity of innovative technologies in different contexts.",Digital innovation in citizen science water quality monitoring in developing countries.,Use of artificial neural networks and multiple linear Other ai Method model for the prediction of dissolved oxygen in rivers,"Facilitating environmental education, increasing scientific literacy and environmental accountability.",smartphones;citizen science;water quality;monitoring;data collection;freshwater ecosystems;sustainable development goals;goal 6 clean water and sanitation;digital innovation;rivers,"This publication discusses innovations in citizen science aimed at advancing sustainable development goal 6, which focuses on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, with a specific emphasis on water quality monitoring in China.",https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/151938

However, water quality in small reservoirs is often not monitored continuously, with the interlinkages between weather, land, and water remaining No Data. Turbidity is a prime indicator of water quality that can be assessed with remote sensing techniques.

Ghosh,s.ghosh@cgiar.org,Vietnam,Report,ML;Other AI Methods,No Data,No Data,"Agricultural land use and practices have important implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. It is, therefore, important to develop methods of monitoring and quantifying the extent of crop types and cropping practices. A ML approach using random forest classification was applied to Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite imagery and satellite-derived phenological statistics to map crop types in the Mekong River Delta, enabling levels of rice intensification to be identified. This initial classification differentiated between broad and prevalent crop types, including perennial tree crops, rice, other vegetation, oil palm and other crops. A two-step classification was used to classify rice seasonality, whereby the areas identified as rice in the initial classification were further classified into single, double, or triple-cropped rice in a subsequent classification with the same input data but different training polygons. Both classifications had an overall accuracy of approximately 96% when cross-validated on test data. Radar bands from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 reflectance bands were important predictors of crop type, perhaps due to their capacity to differentiate between periodically flooded rice fields and perennial tree cover, which were the predominant classes in the Delta. On the other hand, the Start of Season (SoS) and End of Season (EoS) dates were the most important predictors of single, double, or triple-cropped rice, demonstrating the efficacy of the phenological predictors. The accuracy and detail are limited by the availability of reliable training data, especially for tree crops in small-scale orchards.

They also enhance freshwater availability and aid in improving land productivity. These polders are equipped with sluice gates for water to drain out and intake into the polders. Each sluice has its own catchment area, defined by the elevation and connectivity with canal systems that carry fresh or saline water from surrounding rivers or streams. The sluice gates operation is influenced by in-polder water management for crop cultivation, diurnal tidal dynamics, and the seasonal variations of saline and fresh water in the peripheral river networks. During the dry season, limited flows in the lower Ganges River allow seawater to push inland, causing saltwater intrusion in the peripheral rivers until the rainy season. Community-coordinated sluice gate operations can improve water management, facilitating timely drainage and irrigation, which is essential for high-yielding rice and subsequent dry-season crops. To address these challenges, a multi-variate LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was employed to forecast salinity levels in rivers near 29 sluice gates in a polder near Khulna City in southwest Bangladesh. Utilizing salinity data from July 2011 to December 2022, the models were trained (2011-18) and validated (2018-20) with covariates of discharge, water level, and an upstream reference station. A hierarchical variable additive approach was used to sequentially estimate salinity from upstream to downstream. The NSE was over 0.90 and PBIAS under 5% for all sluice gate locations, confirming accuracy in reconstructing the time series. For forecast testing, the 2020-22 dataset also showed significant confirmation with NSE values over 0.90 and PBIAS under 10%. With readily available input data, the developed salinity forecast model can effectively capture annual and seasonal salinity fluctuations along all sluice gate locations. These forecasting capabilities can potentially identify critical seasonal windows for sluice gate operations, giving the farmers in the polder a 30-day lead time for freshwater intake for irrigation and starting agricultural operations in the aman season.",No Data,No Data,No Data,saltwater intrusion;salinity;polders;coastal areas;ML;modelling;sluices,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/168948

Whereas over 50% of maize production in the region is produced by smallholder farmers, spatially explicit information on smallholder farm maize production, which is necessary for optimizing productivity, remains scarce due to a lack of appropriate technologies. Maize leaf area index (Lai) is closely related to and influences its canopy physiological processes, which closely relate to its productivity. Hence, understanding maize Lai is critical in assessing maize crop productivity. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery in concert with vegetation indices (VIs) obtained at high spatial resolution provides appropriate technologies for determining maize Lai at a farm scale. Five DJI Matrice 300 UAV images were acquired during the maize growing season, and 57 vegetation indices (VIs) were generated from the derived images. Maize Lai samples were collected across the growing season, a Random Forest (RF) Other ai Method ensemble based on UAV spectral data and the collected maize Lai samples was used to estimate maize Lai. The results showed that the optimal stage for estimating maize Lai using UAV-derived VIs in concert with the RF ensemble was during the vegetative stage (V8Ã¢â‚¬â€œV10) with an RMSE of 0.15 and an R2 of 0.91 (RRMSE = 8%).

Yet one issue that is rarely considered is how the outcomes of restoration initiatives affect different social groups, specifically women, men, and the marginalized. Our study aims to understand the extent of gender and social inclusion in land restoration studies in Ethiopia. Through analyzing 314 peer-reviewed scientific articles on land restoration initiatives and studies for Ethiopia published between 1985 and 2020, we aimed to: i) develop a novel approach that would allow for the semi-automatization of analyzing gender aspects in a large set of scientific documents using ML techniques, ii) assessed the current evidence on gender integration in peer-reviewed studies related to RDL, and iii) identified what gender issues are discussed in RDL literature. We employed text mining techniques to analyze the literature for keywords and to classify articles into three main classes: gender blind, gender sensitive, and gender transformative, based on the extent to which gender and social inclusion keywords appeared in the studies. Our analysis showed that gender and social inclusion are rarely considered in landscape restoration studies in Ethiopia, as most studies and interventions are heavily focused on the biophysical and environmental aspects of restoration. Despite an exponential increase in the use of gender and social inclusion keywords after 2005, most of the research (58 percent of articles) remains gender blind. The most frequently used related terms remained generic, e.g. community, access, participatory, and tenure. Only 38% of the studies could be classified as gender sensitive to a certain degree, and a strikingly low number of articles (4 percent) Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ which consider the systematic challenges women face Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ could be defined as gender transformative.

Further, Other ai Method analysis was performed for major crops, such as maize and groundnut, using satellite-based climate and vegetation data and observed yield data over a 12-year period. Our results suggested that maize and groundnut crops are mainly distributed in all agroecological zones except the Niayes zone and Senegal River valley in terms of cultivated area and harvested crop yield. We found that seasonal rainfall, particularly from May to September, is highly correlated with the yield, and a 10-20% decrease in seasonal rainfall can lead to crop losses. Additionally, the impact of seasonal rainfall may differ across districts due to climate variability, the onset of monsoon, and cropping seasons.

We, therefore, assessed progress, opportunities, and challenges for modelling NUS using a systematic review. While several models have been calibrated for a range of NUS, few models have been applied to evaluate the growth, yield, and resource use efficiencies of NUS. The low progress in modelling NUS is due, in part, to the vast diversity found within NUS that available models cannot adequately capture. A general lack of research compounds this focus on modelling NUS, which is made even more difficult by a deficiency of robust and accurate ecophysiological data needed to parameterise crop models. Furthermore, opportunities exist for advancing crop model databases and knowledge by tapping into big data and ML.",No Data,No Data,No Data,crop modelling;underutilized species;climate resilience;ecophysiology;sustainability,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/125242

Operational management of reservoirs requires accurate and timely water level information, which remote sensing can provide cost-effectively and with limited resources. In this study, the surface area of 20 reservoirs is first determined using a Random Forest classifier and Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2015 and 2022. The accuracy of the classified surface water areas is evaluated by calculating 5 accuracy assessment metrics. The classifications were validated using manually digitized water areas from high-resolution Google Earth images and compared to the Dynamic World (DW) land cover dataset. Afterward, the spatial variation in the areal extent of the reservoirs is analyzed over time. A linear relationship is established between the estimated surface area and the corresponding observed water level of the reservoirs. The results indicate that reservoir surface areas were accurately classified with Sentinel-2 images (Kappa above 90.35%) for all dates. Moreover, validation with high-resolution images provided an R2 of 0.99 and a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 3.53%. Smaller reservoirs exhibit significant variations in surface areas over time as compared to larger ones, which are more stable. The relationship between surface area and water level is satisfactory (R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.97) for 14 of the 20 analyzed reservoirs. The remaining six reservoirs are affected by aquatic plant intrusion which leads to an underestimation of the surface area. The high accuracy and operational feasibility of the proposed approach demonstrate that Sentinel-2 imagery and ML techniques can be recommended for reservoir mapping within the framework of water level monitoring in Burkina Faso.",No Data,No Data,No Data,water levels;water reservoirs;surface water;surface area;satellite imagery;time series analysis;case studies,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/174414

Rice cultivation accounts for approximately 20% and 10% of the global CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. There is a strong positive correlation between water use in rice cultivation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily because flooded rice creates ideal (anaerobic) conditions for methane-producing bacteria. This study applies the conventional water accounting plus (WA+) framework that uses remotely sensed data products for the Eastern Gangetic Plains (EGP) region to estimate total water use, irrigation water use, and other hydrologic variables. These variables are estimated and assessed for entire cropland areas and selected rice fields across Bihar, India. Results indicated that the conventional WA+ approach ran at monthly time scales and using 250 m spatial resolution data. The results indicate that conventional WA+ was able to capture large-scale variations in water use but failed to capture field-level variations. To address this problem, the WA+ framework was refined to account better for water use in paddy fields. The new framework Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paddy WA+, uses high-resolution remote sensing data (at 30 m), improved runoff, and percolation estimation routines to track water use in the rice paddy fields. This new framework tracks the ponding depth on a daily time step so the amount of water in each rice field is estimated. The next steps include modelling efforts that will correlate the ponding depth with the GHG emissions at the field scale and scaling the emissions based on the empirical relationships between ponding depth and the emissions. The proposed framework is scalable and applicable to paddy-dominated regions worldwide because open-access remote sensing products are easily available.","Field measurement of GHG emissions is cumbersome and time-consuming, underscoring the need for advanced modelling approaches for accurate and efficient estimation.",PaddyWA+ for modeling water use and predicting GHG emission,Easily scalable and applicable to paddy-dominated regions worldwide,water accounting;frameworks;water use;water availability;cropping systems;rice;greenhouse gas emissions;case studies,"The document discusses the application of the PaddyWA+ model for analyzing water use and GHG emissions in paddy fields, particularly in India.

Floods are induced by high rainfall intensity resulting from climate change. Other factors identified as the drivers of the perennial flooding in Nigeria include, poor drainage systems, poor waste management, unregulated urbanization, weak implementation of planning laws and changes in land use without regard to ecological considerations.
 
 Globally, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events have increased since the 1950s. For each 1Ã‚Â°C of global warming, extreme daily precipitation events are projected to intensify by about 7%. It is estimated that flood risks will expand, with three times as many people exposed to the equivalent of a 100-year flood event by the end of this century. Surface water flows and availability will become more variable between seasons and years. Soil moisture levels will decline in some critical farming areas, challenging rainfed agriculture and increasing irrigation needs.
 
 In Nigeria, more than 2.3 million people were displaced, 363 lost their lives and 16 million were impacted in various ways, in 2012. The economic value of the loss was estimated at over US$16.9 billion. In 2022, another major flood led to the loss of 600 lives and 3.2 million people were affected across 34 of the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.

This is the case for Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). At the same time, intense farming practices (particularly on sloped land), deforestation activities, mining extraction operations, challenges in agriculture water management, and soil erosion all contribute to increased land vulnerability. The purpose of this study was to review how the risks of natural disasters related to flooding, landslides, and soil erosion are assessed, measured, managed, and mitigated in the central highlands of Africa, specifically in Rwanda, Burundi, and the DRC. In this process, the risks and the current status of disaster risk management, early warning systems, soil and land conservation practices, and risk mapping were investigated for the three countries.
 
 The literature review revealed a high risk for landslides, flooding, and soil erosion in the region. Risk maps covered the potential risks and helped identify the vulnerable areas. Most of them vary in spatial data, methods, and classifications. They rely on input data on elevation, slope, rainfall, lithology, soil texture, land use, land cover, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The use of heterogeneous data sets and geographical regions in these risk maps may lead to diverging interpretations of potential risks and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhot spotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in spatial terms and the underlying drivers of those risks. None of the risk maps take into account existing population vulnerabilities such as social protection, income levels, or readiness to act in an emergency, such as hospital access in an emergency. Risk maps could be an effective tool for supporting disaster risk management policies and implementations if they are nationally based and built on comprehensive, comparable, and reliable data.
 
 With the rise of climate change-related risks, the need for expended risk mapping is expected to grow. Vegetation cover, deep-rooted vegetation, and soil management practices such as terraces, green barriers, drainage systems for overflows, or similar physical structures are useful land management practices that can reduce risks. Such practices, however, are not in place to the necessary extent in the region.

However, this has been accompanied by increasing input levels and intensive production practices, raising questions about the economic and environmental sustainability of current cropping systems. A multicriteria integrated assessment is required for wheat farms in the region to understand the scope for cleaner wheat production in the future. Production practices from irrigated wheat fields (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3928) were evaluated for multiple sustainability indicators, namely yield gap, nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, profitability, and greenhouse gas emissions. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with simulated potential yield (Yp) data to identify the causes of wheat yield gaps in the region. N-use efficiency was estimated by calculating the partial factor productivity of N, profitability was computed based on reported input-output amounts and prices, and greenhouse gas emissions were quantified using the Mitigation Options Tool (MOT). These indicators were subjected to a multicriteria assessment using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under different scenarios (i.e., different weights for different indicators). For each scenario, farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fields were classified as most efficient, efficient, less efficient, and least efficient, and random forest was used to identify the most important management practices governing the field classification. Wheat yield gaps were small (25Ã¢â‚¬â€œ30Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of Yp or 2.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯t haÃ¢Ë†â€™1) and mostly attributed to the technology yield gap (ca. 20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of Yp or 1.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯t haÃ¢Ë†â€™1). Ranking and grouping the farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fields in the scenario with equal weights for all indicators revealed that at least 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of the fields had very high greenhouse gas emissions (>1500Ã¢â‚¬Â¯kg CO2-eq haÃ¢Ë†â€™1) at a productivity level of <Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯t haÃ¢Ë†â€™1, and that it is possible to produce wheat sustainably without compromising yields in Northwest India, as indicated by the performance of the most efficient fields. Tillage intensity and N application rates can be adjusted for least efficient fields (<10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% least efficient fields adopting zero tillage vs >80Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% most efficient fields adopting zero tillage) to achieve an overall objective of higher yield, lower greenhouse gas emissions, more profit and higher N-use efficiency, whereas residue retention and tillage intensity would need to be prioritized for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. For the most efficient fields the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions was always associated with a decline in yield level. The most important management practices governing the field classification included the crop establishment method used for the previous rice crop, the number of tillage operations, residue retention, and the N fertilizer rate for wheat. The study provides a data-driven approach to screen trade-offs between performance indicators and to identify the management practices that can deliver sustainable and cleaner crop production in the future.",Context-dependent agricultural intensification pathways to increase rice production in India.,Interpretable ML methods to explain on-farm yield variability of high productivity wheat in Northwest India.,provides a blueprint for future integrated assessments of crop production built upon data-driven methods,sustainable agriculture;tillage;crop management;nitrogen;assessment;greenhouse gas emissions;wheat,"This publication discusses pathways and determinants of sustainable energy use for rice farms in India, focusing on the integration of ML techniques to enhance agricultural productivity and resource efficiency.

AMCOW reached out to the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) to support the development of such a program.
 
 AWaQ builds on the rich experiences and lessons learned from past and ongoing regional and subregional water quality initiatives across Africa by different players, including African Union institutions, and the wider members of the World Water Quality Alliance (WWQA), as well as the AMCOW African Water and Sanitation Sector Monitoring and Reporting System (WASSMO).
 
 The five phases of developing an African Water Quality Program (AWaQ) are explained in the following papers:
 
 1. State of Water Quality Monitoring and Pollution Control in Africa (phase 1-2)
 2. Innovations in Water Quality Monitoring and Management in Africa (phase 3-4) 
 3. A Framework for an African Water Quality Program (AWaQ) (phase 5)
 4. Country Water Quality Profiles
 
 This paper is the second in the above list and documents the greatest innovations in water quality monitoring and management in Africa, and proposes interventions to strengthen AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current water quality monitoring and management efforts. Innovations related to monitoring program design, analytical techniques and instruments, deployment of instrumentation and approaches to water quality monitoring are presented together with their applicability and suitability for implementation in Africa. Similarly, water quality management interventions Ã¢â‚¬â€ policy and regulatory mechanisms, catchment-based management, data management and sharing, wastewater reuse and nature-based solutions, among others Ã¢â‚¬â€ are examined. The most suitable interventions are proposed for African contexts using criteria such as affordability, scalability and flexibility. 
 
 Key findings of this paper highlight the following:
 
 1. There are numerous innovations within water quality monitoring and management. However, not all of them may be suitable for implementation in resource-constrained environments characteristic of many parts of Africa. For example, statistical analysis and modelling may require large amounts of existing monitoring data currently unavailable in most African countries. Nonetheless, other interventions such as the priority monitoring approach can be beneficial in optimizing resource utilization. Similarly, technological interventions such as multi-parameter sensors for basic water quality variables are now widely available and affordable in the provision of in situ results and lessening the need for laboratory analysis. 
 2. Available and existing traditional methods of water quality monitoring and management offer a good starting point to further strengthen and streaMLine efforts for increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Currently available laboratory facilities may benefit from instrumentation upgrades and continuous staff training. 
 3. There is scope for community and citizen engagement in the various processes of water resources monitoring and management.

India, with 18% of the global population and access to only 2.4% of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s land and 4% of renewable water resources, faces immense pressure to adopt resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. This study employs a robust multi-criteria decision-making framework, integrating diverse datasets and stakeholder inputs, to guide the prioritization of agroecological interventions.
 
 Two distinct agroecological priority maps were developed in the study. The first map reflects the priorities of Agricultural System Actors and Stakeholders (ASAS), who focus on rainfed, low-productivity zones to minimize risks to food security. The second map incorporates the perspectives of agroecological advocates, who emphasize the restoration of environmentally degraded, high-input agricultural regions. Both maps integrate critical biophysical, climatic, and agricultural factors, including net primary productivity, fertilizer consumption, rainfall patterns, groundwater levels, and aridity indices, among others. These criteria were weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), ensuring alignment with the specific objectives of each stakeholder group.
 
 The studyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s findings highlight high-priority zones for agroecological practices that balance yield improvements and environmental restoration. Approximately 1.5% of agricultural land shows overlap in high-priority class between the two stakeholder groups, indicating consensus on some areas. However, the remaining land reveals significant tradeoffs between food security and environmental sustainability objectives, underscoring the complexity of harmonizing these goals. The maps provide insights into spatial prioritization, identifying key zones for targeted interventions, including regions prone to resource degradation and climate vulnerability.
 
 This report emphasizes the importance of participatory decision-making, dynamic policy formulation, and periodic updates to the agroecological priority maps. It advocates for enhancing stakeholder engagement through wider consultations and workshops, adopting advanced analytical techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and integrating new data layers to improve map precision. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for multilocation trials to validate the findings and tailor agroecological practices to diverse agro-climatic conditions. By aligning regional needs with national and global sustainability goals, the proposed methodology offers a pathway to scale agroecological practices effectively.
 
 The report concludes with recommendations to refine the priority maps, build capacity and awareness among stakeholders, and integrate findings into national policies and resource allocation strategies. These efforts aim to promote sustainable farming systems, ensuring food security for future generations while mitigating environmental degradation and enhancing resilience to climate variability. This pioneering approach to agroecological prioritization provides a replicable model for addressing similar challenges globally, emphasizing the need for contextual adaptation to local conditions.",Limited stakeholder input in priority mapping and need for enhanced accuracy and inclusivity.,Use of advanced analytical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or ML tools.,"Guides targeted interventions in high-priority areas, focusing on water conservation, soil restoration, and sustainable agricultural practices.",agroecology;food security;stakeholders;decision making,"This publication presents a multicriteria-based priority mapping approach to chart agroecological pathways in India.

This traditional method, while effective and very popular amongst farmers, is highly labour, water, and energy-intensive, that leads to significant groundwater depletion and higher energy usage in pumping groundwater. In response to these challenges, the Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) method has been introduced as a more sustainable alternative. DSR involves sowing seeds directly into the field, eliminating the need for growing and transplanting seeDLings. This method, tested in various field trials, promises to have several benefits, including water savings, reduced labour and production costs, higher economic returns, and lower methane emissions. However, the success in farmer fields when adopted at scale outside trials remains to be analysed critically.
 
 In that context, this study was commissioned through a MoU with National Project Management Unit (NPMU), Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY). ABY, also known as Atal Jal, is a central sector scheme aimed at sustainable groundwater management with community participation. Launched in December 2019, ABY focuses on improving groundwater management in water-stressed areas across seven states, including Haryana. The adoption of DSR in Haryana has been gradual but promising. The area under rice cultivation in the state has increased significantly over the years, with initial efforts to introduce DSR beginning around 2009. The state government has played a crucial role in promoting DSR by offering financial incentives to farmers. In 2022, an incentive of INR 4000 per acre1 was introduced to encourage farmers to adopt DSR. Given its uptake in Haryana, the objective of this study is to assess the socio-economic and environmental benefits of DSR, identify the challenges, and offer recommendations for scaling up this technology in Haryana and other regions.
 
 The study employed a multi-faceted approach including qualitative surveys with stakeholders, focus group discussions, field visits, and a large-scale quantitative survey (sample size is 809) of DSR and TPR farmers across selected districts in Haryana to assess the impact of DSR. These farmer-level sources were complemented by water flow meter data analysis and remote sensing analysis.","Weed management is the most significant barrier, with 56% of farmers reporting it as a major issue.","DSR presents a promising alternative to traditional rice cultivation methods, especially in water-stressed areas.","DSR can significantly contribute to mitigating groundwater depletion issues, supporting the broader mission of sustainable groundwater management.",agronomic practices;direct sowing;rice;groundwater irrigation;policies;farmers,"This publication discusses the impact and lessons learned from direct seeded rice practices in Haryana, India, focusing on lessons relevant for scaling efforts.

During the rainy season, the river often overflows, inundating surrounding areas and causing widespread crop and infrastructure damages. Factors such as deforestation and climate change exacerbate this natural phenomenon, leading to loss of lives, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure, farMLands, and livelihoods. An innovative insurance solution has been developed to address these challenges, compensating affected communities for losses incurred during flood events. The CGIAR Initiative on Diversification in East and Southern Africa, Ukama-Ustawi (UU), identified the bunDLing of climate insurance as an innovative climate risk management solution for smallholder farmers in Southern and Eastern Africa. This innovation involved mapping flood-prone agricultural areas near the river, ensuring tailored support for those most vulnerable. The innovation was aimed to mitigate the financial risks associated with recurrent flooding by providing timely insurance payouts to farmers while promoting climate resilience.
 
 The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in collaboration with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE Africa) and Professional Insurance Company piloted the Index Based Flood Insurance (IBFI) among smallholder farmers residing along the Magoye River, Mazabuka District, Southern Province, Zambia. IWMI has developed the IBFI concept in South Asia covering India and Bangladesh using an integrated approach of combining flood model and earth observation data to flood proofing among vulnerable populations (Amarnath et al. 2024). A similar concept was scaled out for IBFI product covering three villages at the lower Magoye Catchment and first of its kind in Zambia. To build trust and enhance resilience within affected communities, a robust flood index insurance product that is flexible, transparent, and closely aligned with ground-level realities was developed. It minimizes spatial, temporal as well as design-related basis risks, ensuring payouts accurately reflect actual losses. During the development of the IBFI product, the experts from the Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA), Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Community Development, Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) in co-designing and implementing with the pilot villages.
 
 The IBFI pilot was conducted for the 2024-2025 rainy season in the Mogoye Catchment, Southern Province, Zambia. The product targets 250 households in the Magoye Catchment of Zambia's Southern Province. Coverage focuses on flood risk, measured via in-situ gauges and satellitemonitored flood depth along the Magoye River. Insurance applies to individual pixels along the river, with each participating farmer receiving about K 1786 equivalent to about USD 64 as the sum insured. The 150-day cover period (November 1, 2024 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 30, 2025) uses a 10-day observation period for flood events. Payouts are tiered based on flood depth percentiles: minor flooding (80th percentile trigger, 25% coverage), moderate (85th percentile, 50% coverage), major (95th percentile, 75% coverage), and catastrophic (99th percentile, 100% coverage).
 
 In summary, the IBFI pilot represents a vital step forward in addressing the twin challenges of climate change and poverty. Its success could herald a transformative approach to flood risk management, offering a lifeline to vulnerable farmers and contributing to sustainable development in the region. Through innovation and collaboration, this initiative underscores the potential of insurance-based solutions in building climate resilience and securing livelihoods.","climate risks, secure livelihoods, and promote sustainable growth",Index Based Flood Insurance (IBFI),build climate resilience for its most vulnerable populations,weather index insurance;flooding;communities;models;satellite observation;stakeholder engagement,"This publication discusses the co-design and implementation of Index Based Flood Insurance (IBFI) aimed at flood-proofing communities in the Mazabuka District of southern Zambia.

Drought can lead to reduced access to drinking water, lower agricultural productivity, and conflicts over water resources. Flooding causes loss of agricultural production, damages infrastructure, and leads to socio-economic losses. The report aims to develop a guiding framework to create a Combined Drought and Flood Index (CDFI) for monitoring crop-specific agricultural drought and flood conditions. The proposed framework for monitoring crop-specific agriculture drought and flood conditions includes meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological indices. The framework uses remote sensing datasets to monitor drought and flood impacts. The cross-referencing of these indices helps reduce the probability of false alarms during monitoring floods and droughts. It is crucial having a uniform methodology that countries can apply to monitor drought and flood conditions for specific crops. The 5-step standardized methodology was applied for the case study country in Ethiopia, where wheat, sorghum, and teff crops are the major crops. The findings show, flooding occurred in the northern and central part of the country in 2016, causing reduced respiration in the soil root zone of crops affecting mid-season phenological growth of sorghum, wheat, teff, and barley. Likewise, the study revealed, in 2015 moderate to severe drought impacted the phenological growth of sorghum due to the El Nino Phenomenon. The framework aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, decision-makers, and agricultural practitioners. The coarse resolution of the rainfall and soil moisture datasets applied in the study might be limitations of this method however, it still provides a valuable oversight for agricultural drought and flood monitoring.","the challenges of data availability, the complexity of standardization steps, and resource requirements for implementation",a five-step framework of the standardized process was proposed and developed for monitoring crop-specific agricultural drought and flood conditions,"offering valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers, agricultural practitioners, and other stakeholders",agricultural production;crops;drought;flooding;remote sensing;datasets;frameworks;monitoring,"This research presents a five-step framework for monitoring crop-specific drought and flood impacts using remote sensing datasets.

The recommendations for IVP interventions presented in this document are informed by an understanding of the complex sociopolitical landscape of Mali and address both challenges and opportunities.
 
 For this study, a comprehensive research process was undertaken involving 19 key informant interviews with humanitarian organizations working in the country. These interviews were supplemented with insights from a wide range of secondary sources including journal articles and project reports. A rigorous approach was adopted to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings and recommendations.
 
 The key recommendations presented here have been carefully crafted to improve the design and implementation of IVP interventions undertaken by humanitarian organizations in emergency contexts in Mali. These recommendations align with the SEADS (Standards for Supporting Crop-related Livelihoods in Emergencies) minimum standards and are intended to complement the SEADS guidance on tools, equipment, and other non-seed inputs as well as impact monitoring and evaluation, thus providing an assurance of quality and relevance.
 
 First, it is important to ensure that the design, planning, and implementation of IVP interventions are contextually relevant while being focused on the unique needs of vulnerable communities. Interventions should be designed to address land access issues, especially for women and internally displaced persons. Security levels (safety risks, political instability, and conflict) should be considered when choosing water-lifting technologies, and interventions must be informed by a gender-sensitive approach.
 
 Second, mobilizing resources and investments is crucial to complement funding shortages for IVP interventions. This can involve measures like promoting space-efficient vertical gardening, supporting domestic vegetable production to procure less expensive and more suitable seeds for local conditions, and strengthening IVP value chains by linking farmers with local seed suppliers.
 
 Third, strengthening organizational capacity for resilience and long-term learning is recommended to enhance the delivery of impactful emergency assistance. This includes adopting a systems approach that considers the socioeconomic and environmental context of the intended intervention and sharing findings among humanitarian actors to foster a learning culture.
 
 Finally, improving data and knowledge management is advised for impactful IVP interventions. This could involve housing all groundwater data within an NGO, promoting the ongoing mapping of suitable irrigation technologies, and ensuring that data is freely accessible to all organizations involved in agricultural interventions.
 
 These recommendations offer a roadmap for humanitarian organizations, donors, and policymakers who aim to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of IVP interventions in emergency contexts within Mali. They provide a framework for engaging with existing policies and governance structures and contribute to creating an enabling environment for effective interventions.",A lack of value chains makes sustained investment in solar-powered pumps difficult and increases the probability of theft.,Vertical gardening and sack gardening are proposed as solutions.,Promotes easier implementation and supervision within household premises and offers a viable solution for maintaining a balanced diet.,irrigated farming;vegetables;agricultural production;intervention;humanitarian organizations;emergencies;food insecurity;irrigation technology;partnerships;climate change,"This text discusses the challenges and interventions needed to enhance irrigated vegetable production in Mali, focusing on the role of local seed production, the informal sector, and gender-sensitive approaches.

Despite being actively involved in various stages of production, including seed sowing, harvesting, and postharvesting, women's contributions are often undervalued. They are often regarded as a cheap labor force and are not given meaningful roles in the supply and value chains. One of the primary challenges they face is the lack of access to and ownership of land, which results in limited and unequal access to resources such as credit, services, markets, and information on modern technologies. These disparities hinder women's participation in market systems and further widen gender gaps and digital divides. Studies have shown that Bangladesh has one of the highest gender gaps in mobile internet usage among low and midDLe-income countries. This study examines the gender digital divide in Bangladesh, focusing on the reasons behind women's exclusion from digital information highways and their limited access to, use of, and benefits from internet-based agriculture and climate-related services and innovations.

However, in dry areas of West Africa, negative effects associated with climate change and widespread water scarcity hamper efforts to increase the productivity of irrigated rice. Quantifying rice yields and water productivity and identifying the drivers for the prevailing variability can aid in the targeting and dissemination of appropriate soil, water, and crop management practices. Objective: The main objectives of this research were: (i) to quantify the rice yield gap in representative irrigated systems in dry areas of West Africa, both in wet and dry seasons, and identify factors that can contribute to narrowing the gap, and (ii) to assess the trade-offs or synergies between productivity and resource (water and fertiliser) use efficiency. Methods: We monitored 203 and 192 smallholder farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fields in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, in four contrasting irrigation schemes in Burkina Faso from 2018 to 2020 and assessed key performance indicators (grain yield, water productivity, and nutrient use efficiency). We calculated rice yield gaps (difference between exploitable and actual farmer yields) and identified the drivers of variability of yield and water productivity using ML and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature importance. Results: Indicators of productivity and sustainability differed between irrigation schemes and seasons. Rice yield was higher in wet (5.3 Mg haÃ¢Ë†â€™ 1 ) than in dry seasons (3.7 Mg haÃ¢Ë†â€™ 1 ), while the variability was higher in the dry (CV = 46%) than in the wet seasons (CV = 29%). Also, the yield gap was slightly higher in the dry (36%) than in the wet seasons (31%). While differences in the number of seeDLings per hill and the source of seeds were the key drivers of yield variability in wet-season rice, the split of N fertilizer applications, bird control, and the soil dryness index were the most important in dry-season rice. Furthermore, within seasons, high-yielding fields had higher water productivity, and N, P, and K use efficiencies. Conclusion: These findings suggest that rice yields can be increased without trade-offs with water productivity and nutrient use efficiencies. Significance: This is the first study highlighting the season-specificity of determinants of variability of yield and water productivity in irrigated rice in West Africa.

 RIICE (Remote sensing-based Information and Insurance for Crops in Emerging Economies) technology, developed since 2010 by sarmap and the International Rice Research Institute, has proven effective in Southeast Asia for monitoring rice production using satellite data. In Nigeria, rice is a key staple crop, yet reliable data on cultivated area and yield are lacking, limiting the ability to design effective interventions for improving productivity.
 Objective
 This study aims to apply and improve the RIICE approach to provide accurate and up-to-date estimates of rice cultivated area, yield, and yield gaps in Nigeria.
 Methods
 Over 1500 geolocated ground-truth points were collected across Kano, Jigawa, and Benue States during the 2022 and 2023 wet and dry seasons. RIICE technology was used to analyze the temporal signatures of satellite data to detect rice areas and crop season start dates. These outputs, combined with agronomic inputs such as soil characteristics, fertilizer use, and water availability, were fed into a crop model to estimate yields and assess yield gaps.
 Results and conclusion
 In the 2023 wet season, estimated rice cultivation areas were 226,702 ha in Kano, 113,871 ha in Jigawa, and 317,282 ha in Benue, with detection accuracy ranging from 85 to 90 % in Kano and Jigawa and 75Ã¢â‚¬â€œ85 % in Benue. Yield estimates showed Kano achieving averages of 5.1 t/ha (dry) and 5.0 t/ha (wet) under irrigated system, while Jigawa yielded 3.9 t/ha (dry) and 3.8 t/ha (wet). In Benue, yields averaged 3.5 t/ha, with some areas producing <1.0 t/ha. Yield gaps were significant: 3.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.2 t/ha in Kano and 4.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.1 t/ha in Jigawa, highlighting the need for targeted agronomic interventions to bridge these gaps and enhance rice productivity.

This paper aims to provide the status quo of (i) current rice production and its challenges, (ii) selected achievements in rice agronomy research mainly by the Africa Rice Center and its partners, and (iii) perspectives for future research on rice agronomy in SSA. The major problems confronting rice production include low yield in rainfed environments, accounting for 70% of the total rice harvested area. Rainfed rice yields are strongly affected by climate extremes such as water stresses, soil-related constraints, and sub-optimum natural resource management and crop management practices by smallholder farmers including poor water management, and suboptimal use of fertilizers, herbicides, and machineries. For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies.

 Quantification of nutrient concentrations in rice grain is essential for evaluating nutrient uptake, use efficiency, and balance to develop fertilizer recommendation guidelines. Accurate estimation of nutrient concentrations without relying on plant laboratory analysis is needed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where farmers do not generally have access to laboratories.
 
 Objective or research question
 The objectives are to 1) examine if the concentrations of macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, B, Cu) in rice grain can be estimated using agro-ecological zones (AEZ), production systems, soil properties, and mineral fertilizer application (N, P, and K) rates as predictor variables, and 2) to identify if nutrient uptakes estimated by best-fitted models with above variables provide improved prediction of actual nutrient uptakes (predicted nutrient concentrations x grain yield) compared to average-based uptakes (average nutrient concentrations in SSA x grain yield).
 
 Methods
 Cross-sectional data from 998 farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fields across 20 countries across 4 AEZs (arid/semi-arid, humid, sub-humid, and highlands) in SSA and 3 different production systems: irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland were used to test hypotheses of nutrient concentration being estimable with a set of predictor variables among above-cited factors using linear mixed-effects Other ai Method models.
 
 Results
 All 10 nutrients were reasonably predicted [NakagawaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s R2 ranging from 0.27 (Ca) to 0.79 (B), and modeling efficiency ranging from 0.178 (Ca) to 0.584 (B)]. However, only the estimation of K and B concentrations was satisfactory with a modeling efficiency superior to 0.5. The country variable contributed more to the variation of concentrations of these nutrients than AEZ and production systems in our best predictive models. There were greater positive relationships (up to 0.18 of difference in correlation coefficient R) between actual nutrient uptakes and model estimation-based uptakes than those between actual nutrient uptakes and average-based uptakes. Nevertheless, only the estimation of B uptake had significant improvement among all nutrients investigated.
 
 Conclusions
 Our findings suggest that with the exception of B associated with high model EF and an improved uptake over the average-based uptake, estimates of the macronutrient and micronutrient uptakes in rice grain can be obtained simply by using average concentrations of each nutrient at the regional scale for SSA.
 
 Implications
 Further investigation of other factors such as the timing of fertilizer applications, rice variety, occurrence of drought periods, and atmospheric CO2 concentration is warranted for improved prediction accuracy of nutrient concentrations.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels this century will alter the protein, micronutrients, and vitamin content of rice grains with potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent countries.",Mixed-effect predictive models that can reasonably estimate concentrations of all 10 nutrients in rice grain,Estimates of macronutrient and micronutrient uptakes in rice grain can be obtained simply by using average concentrations of each nutrient at the regional scale for SSA,production systems;soil properties;inorganic fertilizers;rice,"This publication addresses the impact of climate change on nutrient uptake and utilization in rice through a 2-year experiment.

Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term Ã¢â‚¬Ëœagronomic gainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety Ãƒâ€” agronomic practice Ãƒâ€” environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.","Major challenges to assess agronomic gain include differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain in pilot and scaling stages, unreliable in-person interviews, assessment of some of the KPIs at large scale, and data limitations in different stages.","develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development and introduction of remote-sensing technology and/or mobile devices that can estimate KPIs (e.g., yield, soil health)","facilitate developing, evaluating, and scaling new innovations with proposed agronomic gain assessment to achieve their widespread adoption by different end users based on their needs and preferences",oryza sativa;agronomy;productivity;sustainability,"This study presents a definition of agronomic gain and different approaches for its assessment across varying stages.

 Important gaps exist on dietary intake of adolescents in low- and midDLe-income countries (LMICs), partly due to expensive assessment methods and inaccuracy in portion size estimation. Dietary assessment tools leveraging mobile technologies exist but few have been validated in LMICs.
 
 Objective
 We validated FRANI (Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights), a mobile ai (ai) dietary assessment application in adolescent females aged 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ18y (n = 36) in Ghana, against weighed records (WR), and multi-pass 24-hour recalls (24HR).
 
 Methods
 Dietary intake was assessed during three non-consecutive days using FRANI, WRs and 24HRs. Equivalence of nutrient intake was tested using mixed effect models adjusted for repeated measures, by comparing ratios (FRANI/WR and 24HR/WR) with equivalence margins at 10%, 15% and 20% error bounds. Agreement between methods was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).
 
 Results
 Equivalence for FRANI and WR was determined at the 10% bound for energy intake, 15% for five nutrients (iron, zinc, folate, niacin, and vitamin B6), and 20% for protein, calcium, riboflavin, and thiamine intakes. Comparisons between 24HR and WR estimated equivalence at the 20% bound for energy, carbohydrate, fibre, calcium, thiamine and vitamin A intakes. The CCCs by nutrient between FRANI and WR ranged between 0.30 and 0.68, which was similar for CCC between 24HR and WR (ranging between 0.38 and 0.67). Comparisons of food consumption episodes from FRANI and WR found 31% omission and 16% intrusion errors. Omission and intrusion errors were lower when comparing 24HR to WR (21% and 13% respectively).
 
 Conclusions
 FRANI ai-assisted dietary assessment could accurately estimate nutrient intake in adolescent females compared to WR in urban Ghana. FRANI estimates were at least as accurate as those provided through 24HR. Further improvements in food-recognition and portion estimation in FRANI could reduce errors and improve overall nutrient intake estimations.",No Data,No Data,No Data,adolescence (human);ai;diet;nutrient intake;women,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/130688

Users, including policy analysts and decision-makers, bear the responsibility of evaluating the outcomes from these models. A significant limitation of LLMs is their potential to overlook critical, context-specific factors. For example, in formulating food policies, it is vital to consider regional climate and environmental variables that influence water and resource availability. Nonetheless, due to their reliance on word sequencing probabilities from training datasets, LLMs might propose similar policies for distinct regions. Despite these limitations, LLMs offer considerable advantages for rapid policy analysis, particularly when resources are constrained. They serve as quick, accessible, and cost-effective tools for policy research and development, requiring minimal training and infrastructure. In our study, we assessed the efficacy of LLMs in generating policy briefs by inputting an IFPRI discussion paper into three different LLM-based approaches: a standard chatbot without extra data, a Retrieval Augmented Generation model integrating semantic search with LLM, and a custom-developed Brief Generator designed to create policy summaries from ai-analyzed paper structures.

 Our survey data reveal that vegetable production is ubiquitous, with almost all households surveyed (91%) growing at least one vegetable. Indigenous varieties, such as leafy greens (96%) and fresh beans (69%), are widely cultivated across regions, while high-value vegetables like onion (17%) and tomato (19%) show more regional concentration. Over half (53%) of PNG vegetable farmers sell their produce, with farmers located in the nonseasonal highlands agro-ecological area leading in market participation (66%), contributing to an overall commercialization rate of 24% (defined as the share of pro duction sold). However, modern input use, particularly improved seed adoption, significantly lags behind output commercialization in all agroecological zones except the islands survey areas.
 
 The quantitative analysis, using the PNG Rural Household Survey 2023, and the qualitative analysis, drawing from both manual review and LLM-assisted processing of in-depth interview notes, consistently identify poor feeder roads as critical bottlenecks for every stakeholder across PNG's vegetable value chain. Beyond transportation, these interviews repeateDLy highlighted persistent seed supply shortages and high seed costs as significant hurDLes. Since PNG depends on imported vegetable seeds, several structural and procedural barriers contribute to these shortages. These include potentially arduous quarantine procedures, limited foreign exchange for seed imports, and cumbersome permit processes, often leaving major distributors with insufficient stock. These reported bottlenecks may contribute to the low improved seed adoption and use reflected in the household survey analysis.","Transportation Challenges: roadblocks and floods hinder the route from Hagen to Lae, and sometimes vegetables are damaged in transit.","Building and maintaining feeder roads using river stones is a practical, cost-effective solution that leverages local materials.",Short-term and low-cost interventions could offer immediate improvements.,vegetables;large language models;commercialization;household surveys;ai,"The PNG Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Policy Support Program, managed by the International Food Policy Research Institute and backed by Australian funding, addresses significant agricultural transportation challenges in Papua New Guinea.

Ulimwengu,ifpri@cgiar.org,No Data,Working Paper,NLP;ML;LLM,No Data,"Nutrition, health & food security","This paper presents a novel framework for assessing resilience in food systems, focusing on three dynamic metrics: return time, magnitude of deviation, and recovery rate. Traditional resilience measures have often relied on static and composite indicators, creating gaps in understanding the complex responses of food systems to shocks. This framework addresses these gaps, providing a more nuanced assessment of resilience in agrifood sectors. It highlights how integrating dynamic metrics enables policymakers to design tailored, sector-specific interventions that enhance resilience. Recognizing the data intensity required for these metrics, the paper indicates how emerging satellite imagery and advancements in ai (ai) can make data collection both high-frequency and location-specific, at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. These technologies facilitate a scalable approach to resilience measurement, enhancing the accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility of resilience data.

Sample data issues and the realities of producer heterogeneity and markets, including endogeneity, simultaneity, and outliers can affect such parameters. Methods have continued to evolve that may address data issues identified in the earlier literature examining genetically modified (GM) crops impacts especially those of conventional field level surveys. These methods may themselves have limitations, introduce trade-offs, and may not always be successful in addressing such issues. Experimental methods such as randomized control trials have been proposed to address several control treatment data issues, but these may not be suitable for every situation and issue and may be more expensive and complex than conventional field surveys. Furthermore, experimental methods may induce the unfortunate outcome of crowding-out impact assessors from low- and midDLe-income countries. The continued search for alternatives that help address conventional survey shortcomings remains critical. Previously, existing assessment methods were applied to the impact assessment of insect resistant and herbicide tolerant maize adoption in Honduras in 2008 and 2012. Results from assessments identified endogeneity issues such as self-selection and simultaneity concurrently with influential outliers. Procedures used to address these issues independently showed trade-offs between addressing endogeneity and outliers. Thus, the need to identify methods that address both issues simultaneously, minimizing as much as possible the impact of method trade-offs, continues. We structured this paper as follows. First, we review the literature to delineate data and assessment issues potentially affecting robust performance indicators such as yields and costs differentials. Second, we discuss and apply four types of approaches that can be used to obtain robust performance estimates for yield and cost differentials including: 1) Robust Instrumental Variables, 2) Instrumental Variable Other ai Methods, and 3) Control/Treatment, and 4) ML methods that are amenable to robust strategies to deal with outliers including Random Forest and a Stacking Other ai Method approach that allows for a number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“base learnersÃ¢â‚¬Â in order to examine the pooled 2008 and 2012 Honduras field surveys. Third, we discuss implications for impact assessment results and implementation limitations especially in low- and midDLe-income countries. We further discuss and draw some conclusions regarding methodological issues for consideration by impact assessors and stakeholders.","dealing with collected field data, even when pursuing state-of-the-art sampling, experimental design or random approaches, and other field collection strategies",an integrated approach for an estimation strategy,Adopters had larger yields than non-adopters in both years.,maize;yields;impact assessment;agriculture;data;capacity building;ML;parametric programming;herbicide resistance,"This publication by Zheng et al.

Coming after two successive years of drought, the scheme aimed at reducing the burden of smallholders who borrow at high rates of interest but remain at the mercy of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“weather godÃ¢â‚¬Â to reap optimal returns. Although this new program filled many gaps in the previous crop insurance interventions, it still could not attract smallholder and marginal farmers to fully subscribe to it. It also faced its own set of challenges. It earned farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wrath because of lack of transparency in crop loss assessments and delayed settlement of claims. The government of India had to make the program voluntary under pressure from farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ associations, although it was designed as mandatory for famers seeking institutional credit. This paperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focus is identifying the reasons for failure of PMFBY in most of the states despite its improved features, and comparing these states with a state where it has been relatively successful. It does this through evidence collected from a field study in MarathwadaÃ¢â‚¬â€a drought-prone region in western India, with the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest rate of farmer suicides. It takes learnings from stakeholder interviews in Marathwada to design implementation strategies for PMFBYÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success and win back the confidence of farmers. The state of Karnataka, in contrast to Marathwada, is an outlier among states in India, with a record of successful implementation of the PMFBY program.

Though Karnataka hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet seen full success in terms of penetration achieved in crop insurance, its model can help develop best practices for implementation of PMFBY.

The participatory approach engaged diverse stakeholders, particularly women farmers, to address challenges such as poor production and agrobiodiversity, degraded soils, water scarcity, and livelihood insecurity. Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.
 
 Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of Ã¢â€šÂ¹22,395 to Ã¢â€šÂ¹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.
 
 Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.
 
 Recommendations emphasize a high potential for scaling successful and validated models through collaborative platforms, aligning with government programs, and establishing robust data frameworks for cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem impact assessment. Continued trials and cross-stakeholder collaboration are essential for refining and scaling these practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable livelihoods, enhanced biodiversity, and climate resilience in tribal and rural communities.

Increased urbanization and urban food demand, as well as increasing per capita income, will lead to greater demand for high-value products, including fruits, vegetables, and animal-sourced foods (Chapters 9 and 10). Modern food value chains have emerged in response to such structural changes in food demand (Chapters 11 and 12). However, undernutrition, food insecurity, and poverty are persistent issues in many developing countries (Chapter 10). Building new equitable and viable agrifood systems will be one of the major issues of agricultural development in the coming decades. This chapter asks what agricultural research should be done, who should do it, and who should pay for it. A major challenging global issue in agricultural development is how to cope with climate change (Chapter 19), which accompanies deteriorating stock of natural resources (Chapter 18) and growing water scarcity (Chapter 20). Here too, the questions arise as to who should do what kind of agricultural research and who should shoulder the cost.","excessive regulation can be a significant hindrance to new technologies, both directly by preventing their use and indirectly by discouraging investment in new research.",Development of improved varieties with resistant traits.,Research that allows for adaptation of agricultural and food systems to changes in climate will have significant value.,supply chains;agricultural research;research;agricultural development,"This document discusses the role of public and private sectors in agricultural research and innovation in developing countries.

Since 2008, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has produced the annual Cropland Data Layer (CDL) with 108 crop types and 26 other land-use types for the CONUS Climate Console at 30 meters spatial resolution. According to Boryan et al., 2011, the See5 decision tree classifier model is trained for each Landsat scene with ground truthing data reported by farmers on what is grown at USDAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Farm Service Agency Common Land Units (CLU). The overall classification accuracy for main crops (e.g., corn and soybean) ranged from 5% to 95% in 2009. annual CDL product is available freely at the CropScape web service system. It has been widely used in various agricultural applications and decision-making, such as flood monitoring and crop loss estimation, crop mask extraction for early-season winter wheat identification (Boryan et al., 2019), and land cover change estimation. Some previous researchers studied remote sensing in-season crop mapping using ML models. The pixel-level ML classification algorithm requires high-quality crop-type ground truth data to integrate corresponding satellite images as training samples to train the ML classifier. The quality of these crop labels significantly impacts classification performance because the classifier learns how to distinguish crop types from the labels. This research focuses on producing crop-type maps for Nandi county, Kenya. We surveyed crop typeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ground truth data in Nandi County that integrates time series Sentinel-2 imagery to construct the training sample dataset. The supervised ML model - Random Forest was trained by training samples and employed in crop-type classification for Nandi County. The assessment result confirmed that this workflow performs well for crop type classification with reasonable accuracy. The remaining sections of the report are structured as follows: Section 2 - Study Area and Method, Section 3- Sequential Experiments and Results and Section 4- Conclusion. Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the study area and outlines the methodology employed in the research.

Resulting credit and risk constraints prevent them from investing in their farms. We implemented a randomized evaluation of KhetScore, an innovative credit scoring approach that uses remote sensing to unlock credit and insurance for smallholders including lanDLess farmers in Odisha, a state in eastern India. In our treatment group, where we offered KhetScore loans and insurance, farmers - and especially women - were more likely to be insured and borrow from formal sources without substituting formal for informal loans. Despite increased borrowing, treated households faced less difficulty in repaying loans, suggesting that insured KhetScore loans transferred risk and eased the burden of repayment. Moreover, the treatment enhanced agricultural profitability by increasing revenues during the monsoon season and reducing costs in the dry season. Positive and significant effects are found among both farmers with unconstrained baseline credit access, and quantity rationed farmers, suggesting that KhetScore helps address supply-side credit constraints.

These threats are particularly challenging in Tajikistan, the poorest country in the Central Asia region. Despite the fact that migration is prevalent and remittances account for a significant share of GDP, evidence is scarce as to whether the decision to migrate is driven by weather shocks, whether migration is used as mitigating tool against adverse weather shocks, and how much of the loss in welfare is actually mitigated by such migration. This study aims to narrow this knowledge gap by providing evidence based on a unique panel dataset from one of the poorest and agriculturally dependent regions in Tajikistan (Khatlon province), combined with a detailed set of various climate data. In doing so, we apply a novel approach through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify key weather shock variables among a vast set of potential variables associated with outmigration decisions in different districts. Our results show that different types of weather shocks are associated with outmigration decisions in different districts within the province, ranging from rainfall, temperatures, drought, and windspeed in different subperiods throughout the year. RegarDLess, more abnormal weather is almost universally associated with more outmigration, and outmigration significantly mitigates the potentially adverse effects on household consumption and food/nutrition security in the origin households. However, more abnormal weather in the origin location is also associated with reduced remittances per month per migrant sent to the origin location. Thus, the capacity of migration to mitigate against weather shocks is still limited. Combined with migration policies that increase net earnings during migration, supplementary support to enhance climate resilience in home locations, such as climate-smart agriculture and development of the non-farm sector, remains critical.",Abnormal weather in origin locations (and reduced livelihood opportunities) may force migrants to take up distress work in destination locations.,Applied LASSO approaches to identify the weather parameters that are most clearly associated with migration decisions in each district in the sample.,enhances climate resilience;reduces transaction costs of remittance transfers,climate change;shock;migration;extreme weather events;agriculture;food security,"The text discusses the impact of abnormal weather on outmigration patterns and its effects on food and nutrition security in households of origin locations. It highlights that while outmigration can mitigate adverse effects of weather disruptions, it can also lead to lower remittances per migrant, indicating that the migrant's ability to support their origin household may be limited by their own economic hardships. This reflects a complex interplay between climate factors and human mobility, emphasizing the need for effective migration policies.",https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/175059

Regarding DFS, the WP will investigate cost-effective ways of improving access to and adoption of DFS among smallholders and agri-food SMEs, especially among women and youth.

It examines emerging data on the impacts of COVID-19 on African economies and food systems, reviews the responses of African countries to the pandemic, and advances the discussion on methodologies to measure the impacts of and resilience to shocks. Although the report is centered around COVID-19, its lessons are applicable beyond the current crisis. The pandemic, a uniquely wide-ranging challenge that combined features of previous health, economic and food price shocks, reminds us of the breadth of risks and challenges that food systems must continue to withstand into the future. The report argues for a broader conceptualization of resilience that encompasses climate risks as well as the wider range of shocks that threaten progress toward transformed food systems and economies.

We also find that only 14.6% of the elderly women are nutritionally empowered. These estimates are broaDLy consistent with those based on the 33-indicator WENI. The A-WENI will reduce the time burden on respondents and can be incorporated in any general purpose survey conducted in rural contexts. Many of the indicators in A-WENI are often collected routinely in contemporary household surveys. Hence, capturing nutritional empowerment does not entail significant additional burden. Developing A-WENI can thus aid in an expansion of efforts to measure nutritional empowerment;this is key to understanding better the barriers and challenges women face and help identify ways in which women can improve their nutritional well-being in meaningful ways.;this is key to understanding better the barriers and challenges women face and help identify ways in which women can improve their nutritional well-being in meaningful ways.",No Data,No Data,No Data,models;women's empowerment;gender;ML;empowerment;nutrition;rural areas;women,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/141398

By providing real-time and low-cost observations, satellite remote sensing has been widely employed to estimate crop yield across various scales. Most such efforts are based on statistical approaches that require large amounts of ground measurements for model training/calibration, which may be challenging to obtain on a large scale in developing countries that are most food-insecure and climate-vulnerable. In this paper, we develop a generalizable framework that is mechanism-guided and practically parsimonious for crop yield estimation. We then apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (corn and wheat) in two contrasting regions, the US Corn Belt US-CB, and India's IndoÃ¢â‚¬â€œGangetic plain Wheat Belt IGP-WB, respectively. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLR) model utilizing remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a major input. We compared the performance of MLR to two commonly used ML (ML) algorithms: artificial neural network and random forest. We found that MLR-SIF has comparable performance to ML algorithms in US-CB, where abundant and high-quality ground measurements of crop yield are routinely available (for model calibration). In IGP-WB, MLR-SIF significantly outperforms ML algorithms. These results demonstrate the potential advantage of MLR-SIF for yield estimation in developing countries where ground truth data is limited in quantity and quality. In addition, high-resolution and crop-specific satellite SIF is crucial for accurate yield estimation. Therefore, harnessing the mechanism-guided MLR-SIF and rapiDLy growing satellite SIF measurements (with high resolution and crop-specificity) hold promise to enhance food security in developing countries towards more effective responses to food crises, agricultural policies, and more efficient commodity pricing.",No Data,No Data,No Data,chlorophyll fluorescence;crop yield;developing countries;remote sensing;ML,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/172756

We narrow this knowledge gap using unique district-level and farm-household-level annual panel datasets in India. We start with flexible translog production functions, which are well-suited for identifying cumulative effects in farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ actual production environments. We then apply shrinkage methods (LASSO and GMM-LASSO) to approximate the production function with reduced parameter dimensions, addressing various challenges such as multicollinearity among multiple inputs, including the same inputs from the current and previous years, and potential endogeneity in inputs. Our results indicate that, throughout the shrinkage process, potassium remains a key predictor of outputs, while other inputs (land, labor, capital, irrigation, and other fertilizer nutrients) drop out. More important, the cumulative quantity of potassium from both the previous and current years is a consistently more critical determinant of production than the quantity of potassium from the current year alone, demonstrating the potassiumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significant cumulative effects. These patterns hold at both the district and farm levels across diverse agroecologies and cropping systems. Furthermore, the dynamic panel data analyses suggest that farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ use of potassium in the current year is significantly negatively affected by its use in the previous year, potentially stabilizing outputs across years.

Yet one issue that is rarely considered is how the outcomes of restoration initiatives affect different social groups, specifically women, men, and the marginalized. Our study aims to understand the extent of gender and social inclusion in land restoration studies in Ethiopia. Through analyzing 314 peer-reviewed scientific articles on land restoration initiatives and studies for Ethiopia published between 1985 and 2020, we aimed to: i) develop a novel approach that would allow for the semi-automatization of analyzing gender aspects in a large set of scientific documents using ML techniques, ii) assessed the current evidence on gender integration in peer-reviewed studies related to RDL, and iii) identified what gender issues are discussed in RDL literature. We employed text mining techniques to analyze the literature for keywords and to classify articles into three main classes: gender blind, gender sensitive, and gender transformative, based on the extent to which gender and social inclusion keywords appeared in the studies. Our analysis showed that gender and social inclusion are rarely considered in landscape restoration studies in Ethiopia, as most studies and interventions are heavily focused on the biophysical and environmental aspects of restoration. Despite an exponential increase in the use of gender and social inclusion keywords after 2005, most of the research (58 percent of articles) remains gender blind. The most frequently used related terms remained generic, e.g. community, access, participatory, and tenure. Only 38% of the studies could be classified as gender sensitive to a certain degree, and a strikingly low number of articles (4 percent) Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ which consider the systematic challenges women face Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ could be defined as gender transformative.

Finally, ML techniques are applied to obtain metrics for the relative im portance of different risk factors.
 The results suggest that domestic production volatility is the primary risk factor affecting GDP and poverty in Uganda, whereas world markets and domestic risks are equally important for household consumption and undernourishment. Individually, the most critical risk factors identified include production volatility in root crops, volatility in foreign capital flows, and volatility in fishery production, with the latter being particularly significant for rural low-income households.
 Understanding these economic risks is a critical first step in facilitating discussions on potential risk management strategies, such as promoting domestic productivity growth and diversifying economic activity away from high-risk sectors.",domestic production volatility is the most significant risk factor for GDP and poverty,"Systematic Risk Profiling (SRP) provides a novel approach integrating CGE modeling, household microsimulation, and ML",facilitating discussions on potential risk management strategies such as promoting domestic productivity growth,markets;domestic production;shock;risk analysis,"This publication describes 'Systematic Risk Profiling: A Novel Approach with Applications to Kenya, Rwanda, and Malawi' presented by IFPRI.

About 2.5 billion people depend on these commons for many material and non-material benefits and to support and improve their livelihoods. However, the contribution of the commons to the smallholder farmers and the economy are not very clear. Quantitative analysis of the contribution of ecosystem services will help to develop policies to better support their management and allocate resources to protect them. In this study, we assess the carbon storage and sequestration of the commons in the Thoria watershed, India using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. InVEST is a suite of spatially explicit models for evaluating trade-offs associated with land-use induced ecosystem service changes, developed by the partners of the Natural Capital Project. The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in carbon pools to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time. Aboveground biomass comprises all living plant material above the soil (e.g., bark, trunks, branches, leaves). The model maps carbon storage densities to LCLU rasters which may include classes such as forest, pasture, or agricultural land. The carbon stocking contents of over a hundred samples are measured in the field among major land cover types. The average of carbon stocking values is used and assigned to designated land cover types. The LCL U map is developed by using a ML algorithm with Landsat 7 imageries and ground truth points collected by the local collaborators. The model summarizes results into raster outputs of storage, sequestration, and value, as well as aggregate totals. The ground truth data and remotely sensed data are used to calibrate the parameters of the model inputs. We also perform two scenario analyses: 1) expansion of forest, 2) expansion of agricultural land. The two land-use scenarios are generated using proximity-based approaches where the user determines which land-use type can be converted to, as well as the type of patterns based on proximity of the edge of focal land use. Results of the scenario analysis demonstrate the potential changes of carbon stocking to land cover and land-use change.",No Data,No Data,No Data,ecosystem services;carbon sequestration;watersheds;carbon;forests;land use;ecosystem modelling;biomass;economic situation;policies;soil;farMLand;commons;sustainable development;smallholders;resource allocation;statistical data;livelihoods;ecosystems,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/127780

Using a unique sample of 60 wheat markets in Ethiopia, I examine the relationship between the price obtained by farmers and the quality supplied. Using objective and precise measures of observable (impurity content) and unobservable (flour extraction rate and moisture level) quality attributes, no evidence was found of a strong correlation between the two, suggesting that observable attributes cannot serve as proxies for unobservable ones. Transaction prices further reflect this, indicating that, markets only reward quality attributes that are observable at no cost. However, these results hide cross-market heterogeneity. Observable quality attributes are better rewarded in larger and more competitive markets, while unobservable attributes are rewarded in the presence of grain millers and/or farmer cooperatives on the market site.

Unfortunately, globally, many of the risks in agricultural production have been exacerbated by increasingly erratic and extreme weather patterns (Porter et al. 2014). One way to mitigate such climate risk is the use of seed varieties that are bred to be resilient to the types of extreme weather that crops regularly suffer, such as drought (Cacho et al. 2020). Use of such seeds can potentially help reduce insurance premiums to more sustainable levels, as drought-tolerant varieties could help mitigate losses from moderate droughts and thus insurance would only be required to cover farmers for losses associated with more severe droughts. In this project note, we examine to what extent the use of drought-tolerant varieties is associated with improved performance in the context of a crop insurance project in Kenya. We hypothesize that crops grown from drought-tolerant varieties sustain less damage than other varieties. We test this hypothesis and extend our analysis to ask if there are phenological differences between stress-tolerant varieties (STVs) and non-STVs that would affect the period during which insurance coverage is needed. Finally, since both reduced risk exposure and phenological differences could affect insurance payouts, and thereby insurance premiums in the longer run, we examine differences in farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ yields and insurance payouts between the two groups.",Challenges to deliver genetic gains to smallholder maize farmers,Inclusive Seed Delivery Model leveraging Champion FarmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Entrepreneurial Know-How,"findings also hold across our full sample, with self-reported yields",stress;tolerance;drought tolerance;seed;agricultural insurance;crop insurance;risk;seeds;capacity development,This publication explores the Inclusive Seed Delivery Model designed to improve seed systems for smallholder maize farmers in Kenya by leveraging the entrepreneurial skills of champion farmers.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts correlate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyze to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical process-based crop model (APSIM) applied for rice producers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors, and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data. Our methods and findings can guide efforts to design smart phenology-based index insurance and target yield monitoring resources in smallholder farming environments.","identify and address the most important interactions, synergies and tradeoÃ¯Â¬â‚¬s between climate change, agriculture and food security",Crop modelling and satellite remote sensing to support smart phenology-driven index insurance contracts.,Potential for further improvements in yield estimation accuracy as high-resolution satellite and in-situ crop monitoring becomes increasingly viable in smallholder environments.,capacity development;crop yield;crop production;agriculture;food security;crop modelling;climate change,"The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) engages top researchers to explore the critical relationships between climate change, agricultural practices, and food security, aiming to disseminate research findings and stimulate scientific community feedback.",https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/110712

Firm heterogeneity is shown to be a determinant of trade at both the intensive margin (increase exports per firm/product) and extensive margins (the number of firms exporting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ new products, new partners, new varieties, and new prices). It is now widely accepted that exporting firms are larger, comparatively productive, more skilled, and capital-intensive, and pay higher wages than non-exporting firms.
 The innovations in international trade literature that explains both the emergence as well as levels and the nature of trade flows through value chain integration necessitates examining trade-based exchanges at the highest possible levels of product disaggregation. Developments in trade theory emphasize that it is individual firms not countries that trade and analysis needs to incorporate firm characteristics in decisions and ability for exporting and importing. Firms are the appropriate unit of analysis for trade flows. It helps several paradoxes once the import of firm heterogeneity is understood. Despite the substantive importance of granular level data and the significant level of disaggregated product-level bilateral trade flow data and enhanced computing power that are becoming available, most studies have tended to rely on analysis with high level of aggregation. Recent research on firm heterogeneity in international trade highlights the importance of extensive margins i.e., new products, new partners, new varieties, and cumulative of these i.e., new prices in trade patterns and firms' responses to trade liberalization and other policy changes. However, the high dimensionality of the data and the large number of responses to changes can easily overwhelm researchers. Additionally, bigger data sets may contain more noise, which can mask important systematic patterns. In analysis of trade flows, notwithstanding the rising incidence of differentiated products (varieties) and value chains that transcend national boundaries, methods in agri-food trade analysis in particular have not kept pace in terms of empirical methods and suitable data.","The costs of transporting and time required to trade commodities vary widely across countries in BIMSTEC region, depending on the routes, directions, and commodities.",BIMSTEC Agricultural Trade Monitor Plus (BATM+),"A trade dataset that includes information on time and cost of trade is an important practical need for more granular, global, and up-to-date information to understand the detailed dynamics.",international trade;firms;exports;productivity;wages;value chains;innovation;data;agri-food system;policies,"This publication discusses the challenges of sharing trade data among BIMSTEC member countries, highlighting the complexity of governance and varying transportation costs.

The purpose of this scoping review is to understand how the incentives offered to farmers motivate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and, ultimately, how and whether they result in measurable outcomes. To this end, this scoping review examines the evidence of nearly 18,000 papers on whether incentive-based programmes lead to the adoption of sustainable practices and their effect on environmental, economic and productivity outcomes. We find that independent of the incentive type, programmes linked to short-term economic benefit have a higher adoption rate than those aimed solely at providing an ecological service. In the long run, one of the strongest motivations for farmers to adopt sustainable practices is perceived benefits for either their farms, the environment or both. Beyond this, the importance of technical assistance and extension services in promoting sustainable practices emerges strongly from this scoping review. Finally, we find that policy instruments are more effective if their design considers the characteristics of the target population, and the associated trade-offs between economic, environmental and social outcomes.","The connection between the incentives and actual adoption, as well as the connection between adoption and the outcomes identified play a key role in this scoping review.",ML-based approach helped to identify and cluster common terms and topics covered by the three incentive types,"better indicators of productivity, profitability and environmental sustainability of farms under different production systems and conditional factors.",agriculture;agricultural practices;sustainability;incentives;farmers;economic impact;technical aid;extension activities;quality of life;prÃƒÂ¡cticas agrÃƒÂ­colas;incentivos;sostenibilidad;literature;sustainable agriculture;good agricultural practices,"This publication reviews the environmental sustainability of agriculture amidst changing climate extremes such as drought and excess moisture.

 Among the global and regional articles featured, these focus on key challenges and advancements in nutrition, gender, and health equity. Topics include gender-transformative interventions for adolescents, progress toward global nutrition targets, the links between adolescent pregnancy and anemia, optimal iron supplementation strategies, the applicability of a single child growth standard, and the need for a paradigm shift in anemia assessment. Additionally, discussions highlight shifting power dynamics in global health, inequalities in food environment research, the continuum of child development from conception to early life, and defining healthy diets through a joint FAO-WHO perspective.
 
 Other studies of interest include the latest research on maternal and child healthcare trends and inequality, anemia and micronutrient deficiencies, and malnutrition in children and adolescents, with a focus on Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. These studies examine determinants ranging such as marriage, education, and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empowerment to maternal and child health outcomes. They also explore the intersection of women's work and child nutrition before expanding to broader dietary behaviors and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, providing a comprehensive view of key nutrition and health challenges.

Detailed information on household and individual dietary intake is crucial for adequate nutritional monitoring and designing interventions to improve diets. Common recall-based methods are generally time consuming, costly, and subject to non-negligible measurement errors and potential biases. In addition, the scope of information that can be obtained in a regular survey is typically limited. Detailed diaries, in turn, are effort- and time-intensive and prone to errors. With increasing mobile penetration in both urban and rural areas, meal pictures can overcome some of these difficulties, providing real-time, detailed food intake information of individuals remotely and at a minimal cost. Moreover, pictures can be obtained over extended periods of time, beyond the standard short spans (i.e. 24-hours) in recall survey questions, with little to no data quality loss. Such rich consumption data can help identify and better understand vulnerabilities and nutritional imbalances Ã¢â‚¬â€including specific macronutrient or micronutrient gaps or excessesÃ¢â‚¬â€, and open the door for low-cost, individually tailored digital interventions to promote healthier diets.

A public health challenge is how to reduce exposure to chronic diseases through reinforcement of healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns within populations (Gil et al. 2014). Associations between diet and health outcomes have been observed through longitudinal or retrospective case-control studies, and cross-sectional research studies. Dietary patterns involving healthy food consumption habits among individuals are beneficial in the prevention of diet-related health risks. In dietary patterns studies, it was observed that intake of distinct food combinations is more essential than single nutritive substance or foodstuff consumption (Newby and Tucker 2004). Diet quality assessments that consider overall diet and categorize populations by healthy consumption behavior are crucial tools in monitoring changes within a given population. BroaDLy, there are two methodsÃ¢â‚¬â€namely, a priori and a posterioriÃ¢â‚¬â€that have been employed in assessing dietary patterns. The a priori approach assesses consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ adherence to and application of specific dietary recommendations, whereas the a posteriori approach is data-driven and uses multivariate statistical approaches.",Collaborative community-based services for children and their caregivers could be effective in lowering obesity rates.,Daily group diet and physical activity sessions as part of the 16-week intervention.,"Participants reduced their energy, fat, carbohydrate, saturated fat, and sodium intake while increasing core body strength and endurance.",dietary guidelines;covid-19;diet quality;impact assessment;communities;dietary diversity,"The study evaluated a community-based nutrition and physical activity intervention for overweight or obese children and their caregivers.

Definitions of feminisation of agriculture vary, as do interpretations of what drives the expansion of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roles in agriculture over time. Understanding whether, how, and why feminisation of agriculture is occurring, and finding ways to properly understand and document this process, requires effective research methodologies capable of producing nuanced data. This article builds on five research projects that set out to deepen narratives of feminisation of agriculture by empirically exploring the dynamics and impacts of diverse processes of feminisationÃ¢â‚¬â€or masculinisationÃ¢â‚¬â€of agriculture on gender relations in agriculture and food systems. To contribute to the development of effective research methodologies, the researchers working on these projects associate the insights they have derived in their empirical research with the methodologies they have used. They reflect on how their methodological innovations enabled them to obtain new, or more nuanced, insights into processes of feminisation of agriculture. A first insight is that the definition of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfeminisation of agricultureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a decisive factor in determining the evidence we produce on the process. Second, the feminisation of agriculture should be understood as a nonlinear continuum. Research methodologies need to be capable of capturing dynamics, complexity, as well as multiple and diverse contextÃ¢â‚¬â€and timeÃ¢â‚¬â€specific drivers. Third, bias in data can arise from gender norms which mediate whether women are acknowledged by wider society as farmers in their own right. Such norms may result in significant underestimations of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roles in agriculture.

BangladeshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shrimp production and exports have been in steady decline, since peaking in the early 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. Most shrimp exports from Bangladesh are used by the food service and niche ethnic markets in Europe.
  The complex nature of shrimp supply chains in Bangladesh, comprised of hundreds of thousands of small polyculture farms and tens of thousands of small traders, make it difficult to implement tracea bility and certification initiatives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now a prerequisite for entry into most supermarket supply chains.
 This report provides an overview of the sector and the challenges it faces, drawing on secondary and survey data, reviews of government reports and academic literature. We also report the findings of an expert consultation conducted to identify key constraints and potential solutions.
 The consensus among industry stakeholders who were part of the expert consultations is that issues related to the supply and quality of shrimp seed and pond management practices represent some of the most pressing, yet relatively simple-to-solve challenges currently faced by the sector. This would serve as the foundation for establishing traceability and certification processes. Previous interventions aimed at upgrading production practices (such as promoting stocking of disease-free shrimp seed) and facilitating disintermediation and transparency in the supply chain (such as by establishing producer groups, shrimp collection centers, and contracts with processors), have met with limited success.

In this study, we evaluate the impact of a set of three initiatives in Bangladesh, implemented by a government department, a private sector processing firm and a not-for-profit industrial advocacy body, all involving clustering contiguous shrimp farm ponds to enable group certification necessary for global market access. We implement a canonical difference-in-differences model using two rounds of surveys of a sample of over 1,222 farmers in 2023 and 2024 to assess the impacts on pond management practices, net profits and any unintended impacts on food security and dietary diversity. Our results suggest that the cluster interventions had impressive impacts on adoption of better farm management practices. However, these do not appear to translate into significant gains in net profits, perhaps because these interventions are still relatively new. Further, it appears that cluster farmers pay a penalty on account of a shift to more intensive cultivation, represented by a loss in species diversity and lower incomes from fish and vegetables. We find that there are no significant spillover effects as yet on shrimp farmers in the same village as the clusters. This study reflects critically on the efficacy of clustering that is presumed to enhance access to global markets.","Despite the challenges these pose for rigorous impact evaluation, we believe that studying these different models can produce meaningful and compelling inputs into policy and business decisions.","Matched grant for pond deepening and aggregating a cluster of ponds, uniform practices, buying and selling at one time, intensification, traceability, eventually certification;Cluster approach, arrangement of inputs (feed/seed) on credit for some, knowledge inputs;currently input credit, no contracts yet;Cluster approach, deepening ponds, nursing before stocking, and using SPF PL;cluster-based access to finance.",No Data,transaction costs;farmers;shrimp culture;food security;profit,"This publication evaluates three interventions in shrimp value chains in Bangladesh, analyzing their impact on various metrics including yield, income, and dietary diversity.

 The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa;CONTEXT
 The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa;however, options to increase forage production may entail trade-offs within the farm system that can be challenging to quantify explicitly.
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study examined how maize (Zea mays L.) leaf stripping affected maize and sheep productivity and associated labour requirements, and farm system trade-offs and synergies in four communities in the Northern Region of Ghana.
 
 METHODS
 Maize leaf stripping involved removing almost senesced leaves from maize plants below the cob level at silking. We combined data from three sources: on-farm maize trials with 28 farmers from two seasons (2017 and 2018), on-farm sheep feeding trials where the pasture-based diets of weaner sheep were supplemented with stripped maize leaves fed in pens (conducted in 2019), and farm survey data from 117 households (conducted in 2014), seven of which were in the on-farm maize trials and owned sheep. We examined the trial data using linear mixed-effects models.
 
 RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
 Maize leaf stripping had no significant effect on maize grain yield but had a significant positive effect on maize forage protein yield from leaf and stover. Offering maize leaves to weaner sheep had a significant positive effect on average daily liveweight gain, estimated marginal mean was 29.3 g with maize leaves and Ã¢Ë†â€™10.9 g without maize leaves. For the maize-sheep systems of the seven households, non-inferential statistics suggested that on average maize leaf stripping reduced total maize grain production by 12% (range Ã¢Ë†â€™46 to 38) and increased maize forage protein production from leaf and stover by 90% (range Ã¢Ë†â€™16 to 298). Stripping the maize leaves from one hectare of land took an extra 34 h (range 27 to 42) of labour, which was counterbalanced by reduced labour time for grazing as sheep were fed the maize leaves in pens. For the 117 farmers, heterogeneity in maize areas planted and livestock numbers resulted in heterogeneous production and labour effects of maize leaf stripping. Farmers qualitatively described how maize leaf stripping released labour so children could spend more time at school rather than shepherding.
 
 SIGNIFICANCE
 We quantified in northern Ghana how maize leaf stripping altered crop and livestock productivity and associated trade-offs and synergies in the farm system, including labour. Changes in crop management often have implications beyond the crop's field and examining these implications can provide insights into the suitability of alternative farm management options.

Recurring climate and conflict shocks are making this task more urgent, to ensure that womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voices are included when designing responses to those shocks and as it is possible that climate and conflict shocks could widen participation gaps. Using data from 13 African countries on womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation in subnational political offices as well as survey data on individual political participation, we find, first, that womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representation in local office is associated with higher political participation by individual women (but not by men) in this context. Second, using geo-referenced data on shocks, we show that violent conflict shocks in particular lower political participation for everyone, although the effects are stronger for men compared to women in the 12-month frame that we consider here. Third, we find that, when women leaders hold local political office, the negative effects of conflict shocks on political participation are mitigated for women. These analyses offer important new insights into the relationship between womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political representation and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s individual political activity within the context of shocks.","the effects of shocks, especially violent events, on political participation and collective action outcomes are negative in the short term for both men and women",No Data,"enhance voice and agency, particularly among women in Africa South of Sahara",gender;women;women's participation;political systems;conflicts;shock;climate;fragility,"This study explores the relationship between women's representation in local political offices and individual political participation in 13 African countries amidst conflicts and climate shocks.

The advent of new data sources, including national accounts and phone survey data, provides an opportunity for a thorough reassessment of the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent expansion of social protection systems on the evolution of poverty in Africa. In this paper, we combine per capita GDP growth from national accounts with data from High-Frequency Phone Surveys for several countries to estimate the net impact of the pandemic on poverty. We find that the pandemic has increased poverty in Africa by 1.5-1.7 percentage points in 2020, relatively smaller than early estimates and projections. We also find that countries affected by Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) experienced the greatest increases in poverty, about 2.1 percentage points in 2020. Furthermore, we assess and synthesize empirical evidence on the role that social protection systems played in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Africa. We review social protection responses in various African countries, mainly focusing on the impact of these programs and effectiveness of targeting systems.

Moreover, the context-specificity of empowerment implies that a quantitative measure alone will be inadequate to capture the nuances of the empowerment process. The Gender, Agriculture, and Assets Project, Phase 2 (GAAP2), a portfolio of 13 agricultural development projects in nine countries in South Asia and Africa, developed the project-level WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEai) and qualitative protocols for impact evaluations. Pro-WEai covers three major types of agencies: instrumental, intrinsic, and collective. This paper synthesizes the results of 11 mixed-methods evaluations to assess these projectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ empowerment impacts. The projects implemented the pro-WEai and its associated qualitative protocols in their impact evaluations. Our synthesis finds mixed, and mostly No Data impacts on aggregate indicators of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empowerment, with positive impacts more likely in the South Asian, rather than African, cases. There were more significant impacts on instrumental agency indicators and collective agency indicators, reflecting the group-based approaches used. We found few significant impacts on intrinsic agency indicators, except for those projects that intentionally addressed gender norms. Quantitative analysis does not show an association between the types of strategies that projects implemented and their impacts, except for capacity building strategies. This finding reveals the limitations of quantitative analysis, given the small number of projects involved. The qualitative studies provide more nuance and insight: some base level of empowerment and forms of agency may be necessary for women to participate in project activities, to benefit or further increase their empowerment. Our results highlight the need for projects to focus specifically on empowerment, rather than assume that projects aiming to reach and benefit women automatically empower them.

Intensification of tilapia farming has exacerbated losses caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Disease diagnostics play a crucial role in biosecurity and health management to mitigate disease loss and improve animal welfare in aquaculture. Three continuous levels of diagnostics (I, II and III) for aquatic species have been proposed by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Network of Aquaculture Centers in Asia and the Pacific (NACA) to promote the integration of basic and advanced methods to achieve accurate and meaningful interpretation of diagnostic results. However, the recent proliferation of cutting-edge molecular methods applied in the diagnosis of diseases of aquacultured animals has shifted the focus of researchers and users away from basic approaches and toward molecular diagnostics, despite the fact that many diseases can be rapiDLy diagnosed using inexpensive, simple microscopic examination and that most emerging diseases in aquaculture were discovered by histopathology. This review, therefore, revisits and highlights the importance of the three levels of diagnostics for diseases of tilapia, particularly the frequently overlooked basic procedures (e.g., case history records, gross pathology, presumptive diagnostic methods and histopathology). The review also covers current and emerging molecular diagnostic technologies for tilapia pathogens including polymerase chain reaction methods (conventional, quantitative, digital), isothermal amplification methods Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection, lateral flow immunoassays, as well as discussing what is on the horizon for tilapia disease diagnostics (next generation sequencing, ai, environmental Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) and point-of-care testing) providing a future vision for transferring these technologies to farmers and stakeholders for a sustainable aquatic food system transformation.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/129622

However, qualitative and quantitative studies on such practices to evaluate their socioeconomic vulnerability based on primary data of farmers' opinions are sparse. In this study, we attempted to identify the factors responsible for the success and lapses in rice-fish coculture in five villages of Ziro Valley in the lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. We conducted an exhaustive field survey to collect primary data through questionnaires survey, focus group discussions, and interviews. Then, we analyzed the data by applying ai and ML algorithms to identify the stresses and recommend guidelines to improve farmers' management and decision-making for sustainable rice-fish coculture. The results of the general linear Other ai Method, considering fifteen variables, Akaike information criterion, and the decision tree on three important responses of the farmers indicate that the the current practice of rice-fish coculture in the Ziro Valley yields poor returns. We identified that mismanagement of inputs, unwillingness to invest, nonavailability of adequate funds and formal training, and limited involvement of youths in the culture are crucial factors behind poor returns. However, institutional support in managing stocking density, feed, and rice type, along with human resource training, can address these gaps, thereby improving the production and livelihoods of a significant section of the Apatani tribe.","Farmers in the study area face constraints like limited capital, unwillingness to invest in feed and land preparation, and excessive labor use due to a misconception that more physical effort leads to higher production.

The participatory approach engaged diverse stakeholders, particularly women farmers, to address challenges such as poor production and agrobiodiversity, degraded soils, water scarcity, and livelihood insecurity. Key interventions included Agroecological Homestead Models (AHMs), Krishi-Kund for land restoration, Solar Irrigation Systems based diversified farming, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS), Integrated Rice-Fish Farming, and homeopathic formulations for crop improvement.

Preliminary results highlight promising outcomes. AHMs demonstrated income diversification, with gross returns 7.9 to 22.5 times higher and net returns also showing improvement, albeit constrained by high initial costs. Microsite improvements enhanced productivity by 2.39 to 5.71 times compared to control sites, with net returns ranging from 0.74 to 4.36 times higher. Solar irrigation reduced fossil fuel dependence and enabled initial crop diversification. IFS models showed net incomes of â‚¹22,395 to â‚¹54,563 (USD 259 to USD 630) with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, water productivity in the range of INR 5.6 to 10.3 per cubic meter of water used demonstrating the potential to enhance resource use efficiency, resilience, and income diversification. Integrated Rice-Fish Farming improved soil health, dietary diversity, and incomes, while initial farmer trials of a homeopathic solution indicated yield improvements of 1.12 to 1.61 times compared to their own controls. Based on the limited replicates, simple experimental designs and short duration of the trials, these results remain preliminary. Further validations and assessments of cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and performance consistency under multi-seasonal climatic variability and a larger number of samples have been suggested.

Key lessons include the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with scientific practices, leveraging women-led groups for adoption, and implementing targeted capacity-building programs. Challenges such as climatic variability, delayed adoption, and limited market access highlight the need for adaptive strategies and extended experimentation.

Recommendations emphasize a high potential for scaling successful and validated models through collaborative platforms, aligning with government programs, and establishing robust data frameworks for cost-benefit analysis and ecosystem impact assessment. Continued trials and cross-stakeholder collaboration are essential for refining and scaling these practices, ultimately contributing to sustainable livelihoods, enhanced biodiversity, and climate resilience in tribal and rural communities.

Among these challenges are the inadequate supply of quality seed, limited credit access, poor availability of quality fish feed, land-use conflicts, the adverse effects of climate change, and the low adoption of best aquaculture management practices. These challenges spiral into low productivity, low incomes, and low food security of households. Extension has been seen as an important tool for technology and knowledge transfer, resulting in increased farm productivity and household food security. However, small-scale aquaculture farmers in Bangladesh lack access to critical extension service needed to improve productivity and their livelihoods. Using Propensity Score Matching, we test whether more decentralized extension systems yield similar food security outcomes as traditional extension models. Analysing data from 1,017 respondent, we find that decentralized extension models lead to improved food security of aquaculture households compared to non-beneficiaries. We recommend among others, the critical need to synergize extension systems, reduce costs and better target aquaculture farmers. Additionally, public-private partnerships can help leverage strengths from various extension approaches for more effective knowledge dissemination to aquaculture farmers, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods.","Difficulty in ensuring accountability in decentralized extension delivery, inefficient resource use and corruption, and challenges related to the sustainability of extension delivery due to project-based funding cycles.",extension services,Enhancing the efficiency and reach of extension services by bringing critical information and technologies closer to aquaculture farmers and meeting their specific local needs.,agriculture;extension;technology adoption;rural development;food security,"This document comprises a list of academic publications related to agriculture and aquaculture.

However, climate change presents a major risk threatening both quality and quantity of aquaculture production. The environmental stressors in aquaculture resulting from climate change, are temperature rise, salinity changes, sea level rise, acidification and changes of other chemical properties and changes of oxygen levels. Although a reasonable genetic gain can be achieved by selective breeding, this genetic response may not be enough to adapt fish species to the effects of climate change. Marker assisted selection focusing on specific genes or alleles that allow fish to cope with
these changes would allow more rapid adaptation of fish to these new environments. In this thesis, I focused on three essential environmental stressors - dissolved oxygen, salinity and temperature as primarily determined in aquaculture production. The main objective is to provide insight in the genomic architecture underlying the mechanism of adaptation to challenging environments of aquaculture
species under farming conditions. First, I determined candidate QTL associated with phenotypic variation during adaptation to hypoxia or normoxia. I identified overrepresented pathways that could explain the genetic regulation of hypoxia on growth. To identify fish with better hypoxia tolerance and growth under a hypoxic environment, I quantified the genetic correlations between an indicator trait for hypoxia tolerance (critical swimming performance) and growth. Moreover, the genomic architecture associated with swimming performance was demonstrated, while the effect of significant QTLs on growth was estimated. Beyond applying genome-wide association studies, I used selection signatures to identify QTLs and
genes contributing to salinity tolerance. In addition, I also compared the genome of the saline-tolerant and highly productive tilapia â€œSukamandiâ€, that was developed by the aquaculture research institute in Indonesia, to that of blue tilapia and Nile tilapia, to identify the QTLs contributing to salinity tolerance. Finally, I investigated QTLs associated with growth-related traits and organ weights at two distinct
commercial Mediterranean product sites differing in temperature (farms in Spain and Greece). Overall, this thesis considerably adds to insight into how fish adapt to challenging environments, which will aid marker-assisted selection for improved resilience of aquaculture species under climate change.",Hypoxia is an important cause of economic losses in aquaculture.,Understanding the genomic architecture of hypoxia adaptation could help to improve resilience through breeding programs for economically important species.,Improve resilience through breeding programs for economically important species.,oxygen adaptation;genotype;phenotype;reference genome;ethics,This study investigates oxygen adaptation in tilapia.

Beyond its importance for food security and nutrition, small scale aquaculture contributes to the livelihoods of many rural households and is a potentially valuable strategy for rural development. However, small-scale aquaculture producers have limited access to improved production technologies and information, which hampers the productivity and socioeconomic performance of small-scale aquaculture systems. In this study we assessed the impact of the adoption of better management practices and exposure to nutrition-sensitive training by 379 small-scale aquaculture producers in the Sagaing and Shan regions of Myanmar. We focused on whether and how the exposure to these interventions affected household food security through improvements in productivity and livelihoods. We used Propensity Score Matching to compare the performance of groups that were exposed to the intervention for one or two years, for seven impact variables. Exposure to the intervention had a positive effect for most impact variables, with differentiated effects among variables, group comparisons and regions. In terms of food security, beneficiaries had significantly higher dietary diversity (measured as the Food Consumption Score, FCS), but there were no significant differences for fish self-consumption (measured in kg/week). Longer exposure to the interventions produced significantly higher positive effects across most impact variables for the 2-year beneficiaries compared to 1-year beneficiaries and control groups. Our study suggests that the length of exposure to such interventions can be important in mediating the actual impact of small-scale aquaculture systems on household food security and livelihoods. Sustained help to small-scale producers should be considered in initiatives and development projects seeking to enhance the food security and rural development of small-scale aquaculture systems in Myanmar, and beyond.","low productivity and

Our current work has attempted to comprehend this by employing the 13 principles of agroecology as
the standard framework for evaluating the performance and providing necessary guidance for selected farming systems. It was discovered during this process that farmers need to be given the appropriate interpretation of these mechanisms to aid them
in decision-making when engaging in agroecological practices. ai-driven methods have proven to be useful for helping farmers with precision farming methods. Predictive analytics and enhanced farm and crop management systems within an agroecological
framework ensure crop quality and supply. Farmers should use the advantage of big data, ai, and ML technologies to predict prices, determine the health of the environment, and compute agricultural output and yield. The best crop kinds to plant for maximum profit, the optimal environmental conditions, the need for agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers, supplemental feed, etc.), and farming economics are all things it may advise farmers on.

Bangladeshâ€™s shrimp production and exports have been in steady decline, since peaking in the early 2010â€™s. Most shrimp exports from Bangladesh are used by the food service and niche ethnic markets in Europe.
 The complex nature of shrimp supply chains in Bangladesh, comprised of hundreds of thousands of small polyculture farms and tens of thousands of small traders, make it difficult to implement tracea bility and certification initiatives â€“ now a prerequisite for entry into most supermarket supply chains.
This report provides an overview of the sector and the challenges it faces, drawing on secondary and survey data, reviews of government reports and academic literature. We also report the findings of an expert consultation conducted to identify key constraints and potential solutions.
The consensus among industry stakeholders who were part of the expert consultations is that issues related to the supply and quality of shrimp seed and pond management practices represent some of the most pressing, yet relatively simple-to-solve challenges currently faced by the sector. This would serve as the foundation for establishing traceability and certification processes. Previous interventions aimed at upgrading production practices (such as promoting stocking of disease-free shrimp seed) and facilitating disintermediation and transparency in the supply chain (such as by establishing producer groups, shrimp collection centers, and contracts with processors), have met with limited success. We outline potential interventions and partners that might offer scalable solutions enabling small shrimp farmers to access global markets.","The complex nature of shrimp supply chains in Bangladesh, comprised of hundreds of thousands of small farms and tens of thousands of small traders, make it difficult to implement traceability and certification initiatives â€“ now a prerequisite for entry into most supermarket supply chains.

During this period, Bangladesh faced an estimated loss of around 140 million USD for hatcheries, open water fish and shrimp. When validated with a year of country-wide official data on climate-induced economic losses to aquaculture, the damage reported from these media sources is approximately 10 percent of actual losses. Given this rule of thumb, the potential economic value of aquacultural CIS could be up to USD14 million a year, if 10 percent of the damage can be offset by appropriate services through a range of multi-sector efforts to establish and extend these services to farmers at scale.",cliamte idnuced loss and/or damge of fish-farmers,aquaculture decsion framework,"catalysing aquaculture growth, enhancing nutritional security and contributing to

To address this gap, we employed the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) approach to develop habitat suitability maps for different seaweed cultivation systems encompassing the entire coastal and marine territorial areas of Bangladesh. Our study leveraged an in-situ dataset comprising production and environmental factors from 180 cultivation plots of four species (Gracilaria sp., Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca, and Hypnea musciformis) across five cultivation sites, supplementing this data with other ecological variables derived from satellite observations and model simulations. The GAM analysis identified seven key explanatory variables that collectively accounted for 78 %, 76 %, and 79 % of the observed variability in seaweed data for off-bottom long-line, off-bottom net, and floating long-line cultivation systems, respectively. The model predicted that total suspended solids (TSS) predominantly influenced the habitat suitability for off-bottom net and floating long-line cultivation systems, while salinity was a crucial determinant for off-bottom long-line cultivation systems. The study further demonstrated that the predicted suitable areas (50â€“100 %) for floating long-line cultivation systems (1850 km2) substantially outnumbered those for off-bottom long-line (372 km2) and off-bottom net (380 km2) cultivation systems. The model showed that the southeast coast, specifically the sandy bottom areas of the Moheshkhali channel and its surroundings, exhibited high suitability (>75 % probability) for off-bottom long-line and off-bottom net cultivation systems. In contrast, the floating long-line cultivation system appeared most suitable for seaweed farming along almost the entire coastline of Bangladesh, excluding the Meghna and adjacent estuaries in the central region. Notably, the most suitable areas were specifically concentrated in the coastal areas of Moheshkhali Island, Cox's Bazar, Teknaf, and Saint Martin's Island in the southeast coastal zone, extending potentially to far offshore waters. The predictions of our model aligned well with in-situ observations, as evidenced by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and an R2 value of 0.85. The insights gleaned from this research offer invaluable guidance to seaweed farmers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of the emerging seaweed-based blue economy in Bangladesh.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/152299

Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create trade-offs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind.

Governments are increasingly holding the private sector responsible for their role in climate change impacts. Extreme weather events are incredibly costly for businesses. This is particularly true in agriculture, which relies heavily on favorable weather conditions. CSA practices and technologies are central to the transformative changes necessary to maintain the stabilityâ€”and profitabilityâ€”of the food system in the face of climate change. Where robust information on the benefits, costs, and risks of interventions is missing or incomplete, would-be investors, including donors, governments, businesses, and farmers, remain uninformed of the potentially massive dividends climate-smart investments could offer. This dearth of viable business models ultimately hinders the mainstreaming of productive, climate-resilient, low-emissions agriculture. Robust business-case analyses of CSA could accelerate the scaling of promising, profitable technologies by transparently and rigorously laying out the monetary and nonmonetary values of performance. We use existing data from Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA, previously known as The Compendium) to develop a general framework for establishing the business case for specific farm-level agricultural technologies. The framework focuses on the costs, benefits, and risks of adoption of CSA by smallholder farmers. We illustrate the application of the framework with two case studies in Kenya and Malawi to highlight opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned from building business cases for CSA. These give potential investors the tools to screen and select appropriate technologies and help de-risk investments where data are few and far between.",production risks by up to 29%,"combination of crops, trees and mineral fertilizer","Generating and sharing knowledge about the performance of management options can help farmers take more informed, context-tailored decisions.",climate change;agriculture;food security;research;development,"The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) aims to identify and address key interactions and tradeoffs between climate change, agriculture, and food security, leveraging expertise from various scientific fields.

Whereas legumes can meet a large part of their nitrogen (N) requirement through symbiosis with N2-fixing bacteria, elements such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and secondary and micronutrients may still be limiting and require supplementation. Responses to P are generally strong but variable, while evidence for other nutrients tends to show weak or highly localised effects. Here we present the results of a joint statistical analysis of a series of on-farm nutrient addition trials, implemented across four legumes in four countries over two years. Linear mixed models were used to quantify both mean nutrient responses and their variability, followed by a random forest analysis to determine the extent to which such variability can be explained or predicted by geographic, environmental or farm survey data. Legume response to P was indeed variable, but consistently positive and we predicted application to be profitable for 67% of farms in any given year, based on prevailing input costs and grain prices. Other nutrients did not show significant mean effects, but considerable response variation was found. This response heterogeneity was mostly associated with local or temporary factors and could not be explained or predicted by spatial, biophysical or management factors. An exception was K response, which displayed appreciable spatial variation that could be partly accounted for by spatial and environmental covariables. While of apparent relevance for targeted recommendations, the minor amplitude of expected response, the large proportion of unexplained variation and the unreliability of the predicted spatial patterns suggests that such data-driven targeting is unlikely to be effective with current data.",Influence of phosphorus application on growth and yield of soybean genotypes in the tropical savannas of northeast Nigeria.,Random Forest model using all remote sensing variables,"Despite limited ability to statistically model yield and response, the inclusion of selected survey questions improved our ability to explain the observed variation.",agriculture;legumes;nutrient application;food security;sub-Saharan Africa,"The publication discusses the influence of phosphorus application on soybean growth and yield across different regions in sub-Saharan Africa.

Quantification of nutrient concentrations in rice grain is essential for evaluating nutrient uptake, use efficiency, and balance to develop fertilizer recommendation guidelines. Accurate estimation of nutrient concentrations without relying on plant laboratory analysis is needed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where farmers do not generally have access to laboratories.

Objective or research question
The objectives are to 1) examine if the concentrations of macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, B, Cu) in rice grain can be estimated using agro-ecological zones (AEZ), production systems, soil properties, and mineral fertilizer application (N, P, and K) rates as predictor variables, and 2) to identify if nutrient uptakes estimated by best-fitted models with above variables provide improved prediction of actual nutrient uptakes (predicted nutrient concentrations x grain yield) compared to average-based uptakes (average nutrient concentrations in SSA x grain yield).

Methods
Cross-sectional data from 998 farmersâ€™ fields across 20 countries across 4 AEZs (arid/semi-arid, humid, sub-humid, and highlands) in SSA and 3 different production systems: irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland were used to test hypotheses of nutrient concentration being estimable with a set of predictor variables among above-cited factors using linear mixed-effects Other ai Method models.

Results
All 10 nutrients were reasonably predicted [Nakagawaâ€™s R2 ranging from 0.27 (Ca) to 0.79 (B), and modeling efficiency ranging from 0.178 (Ca) to 0.584 (B)]. However, only the estimation of K and B concentrations was satisfactory with a modeling efficiency superior to 0.5. The country variable contributed more to the variation of concentrations of these nutrients than AEZ and production systems in our best predictive models. There were greater positive relationships (up to 0.18 of difference in correlation coefficient R) between actual nutrient uptakes and model estimation-based uptakes than those between actual nutrient uptakes and average-based uptakes. Nevertheless, only the estimation of B uptake had significant improvement among all nutrients investigated.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that with the exception of B associated with high model EF and an improved uptake over the average-based uptake, estimates of the macronutrient and micronutrient uptakes in rice grain can be obtained simply by using average concentrations of each nutrient at the regional scale for SSA.

Implications
Further investigation of other factors such as the timing of fertilizer applications, rice variety, occurrence of drought periods, and atmospheric CO2 concentration is warranted for improved prediction accuracy of nutrient concentrations.",potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent countries,mixed-effect predictive models,Estimates of the macronutrient and micronutrient uptakes in rice grain can be obtained simply by using average concentrations of each nutrient at the regional scale for SSA.,rice;nutrient uptake;climate change;health consequences;ionomic variation,"This publication discusses the effects of climate change on nutrient uptake and utilization in rice, revealing potential health consequences for rice-dependent countries.

Over the last 20 years, coffee farms and landscapes across the region have undergone rapid and profound biophysical changes in response to low coffee prices, changing climatic conditions, severe plant pathogen outbreaks, and other drivers. Although these biophysical transformations are pervasive and affect millions of rural livelihoods, there is limited information on the types, location, and extent of landscape changes and their socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Here we review the state of knowledge on the ongoing biophysical changes in coffee-growing regions, explore the potential socioeconomic and ecological impacts of these changes, and highlight key research gaps. We identify seven major land-use trends which are affecting the sustainability of coffee-growing regions across Latin America in different ways. These trends include (1) the widespread shift to disease-resistant cultivars, (2) the conventional intensification of coffee management with greater planting densities, greater use of agrochemicals and less shade, (3) the conversion of coffee to other agricultural land uses, (4) the introduction of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) into areas not previously cultivated with coffee, (5) the expansion of coffee into forested areas, (6) the urbanization of coffee landscapes, and (7) the increase in the area of coffee produced under voluntary sustainability standards. Our review highlights the incomplete and scattered information on the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of biophysical changes in coffee landscapes, and lays out a detailed research agenda to address these research gaps and elucidate the effects of different landscape trajectories on rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and other aspects of sustainable development.

Here, we present a mid-infrared soil spectral library (SSL) for central Africa (CSSL) that can predict key soil properties, allowing for future soil estimates with a minimal need for expensive and time-consuming wet chemistry. Currently, our CSSL contains over 1800 soil samples from 10 distinct geoclimatic regions throughout the Congo Basin and along the Albertine Rift. For the analysis, we selected six regions from the CSSL, for which we built predictive models for total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) using an existing continental SSL (African Soil Information Service, AfSIS SSL;n=1902) that does not include central African soils. Using memory-based learning (MBL), we explored three different strategies at decreasing degrees of geographic extrapolation, using models built with (1) the AfSIS SSL only, (2) AfSIS SSL combined with the five remaining central African regions, and (3) a combination of AfSIS SSL, the remaining five regions, and selected samples from the target region (spiking). For this last strategy we introduce a method for spiking MBL models.

We assessed strategies that leveraged both deep and handcrafted features, namely hybridized and ensembled ai architectures. Our approach considered two different datasets collected during the two seasons (2021 and 2022), with the training set from the first season only. This allowed for testing of the modelsâ€™ robustness, particularly their sensitivity to concept drifts, in the independent season (2022), which is fundamental for practical agriculture applications. Our findings underscore the superiority of hybrid and ensembled ai algorithms in these experiments. The MLP + CNN-VGG16 combination achieved the best accuracy (R2 = 0.733, MAE = 0.264 N% on an independent dataset). This study emphasized that carefully crafted ai-based models applied to RGB images can achieve robust trait prediction with accuracies comparable to the similar phenotyping tasks using more complex (multi- and hyper-spectral) sensors presented in the current literature.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/158402

In this regard, the increased frequency of climate change-related extreme rainfall and floods in recent years has worsened the risks faced by farmers. A substantial amount of research on climate change, extreme rainfall and floods have already been completed within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, demonstrating diverse implications across geographies, commodities, and populations. However, there is a need to provide a synthesized and comprehensive analysis of this research corpus to advance the understanding of the current state of knowledge in this area, identify knowledge gaps and inform future studies. This protocol provides a roadmap for the synthesis of CGIAR research in the space of hazards arising from climate-induced extreme rainfall and floods and associated adaptation solutions. It assesses the impacts of these solutions, as well as the impacts of extreme rainfall and floods on natural, agricultural, and human systems. The protocol includes an examination of the methods employed to estimate the impacts. Ultimately, this review will identify possible entry-points for supporting the upscaling of any impactful interventions designed in this landscape.
Methods - The review will follow the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) processes. As part of article selection, ML was deployed to semi-automate identification of existing relevant CGIAR literature from Nine CGIAR institution data repositories, specifically focusing on the impact of climate-induced extreme rainfall and floods on agricultural production and food security, with English being used as the main language. The search results from this database were exported into Excel, merged, and then imported into a new Rayyan project. Duplicates were removed, while titles and abstracts were double-screened using specific inclusion-exclusion criteria. The screening and selection of studies were conducted by two independent researchers. During the review and synthesis process, data will be extracted using ai software, and a codebook will be developed to ensure consistency and reproducibility. The review and detailed narrative synthesis will focus on the methods, adaptation solutions, and impacts of CGIAR research related to climate-induced extreme rainfall and floods. Analysis of the data will also be guided by our understanding of livelihoods and food security imperatives.
Results - Out of 2846 identified papers, 107 studies met our search criteria and will be included in this systematic review. Preliminary insights from the included papers show that several innovations can be deployed by farmers to address extreme rainfall and floods. This includes the deployment of climate-smart agricultural innovations, use of early-warning systems for extreme rainfall and floods, the design and implementation of national policies and institutions that support adaptation and institutionalizing anticipatory action that can be taken at the local and national level to mitigate the impacts of extreme rainfall and floods.
Conclusion - This systematic review is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge on climate-induced extreme rainfall and floods within the CGIAR, identify critical knowledge gaps, and inform future research priorities to enhance crop resilience and food security. Ultimately, the review will identify possible entry-points for supporting the upscaling of any impactful interventions designed in this landscape.

Methods: In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of the Kenya animal health surveillance system (1944 to 2024), based on a review of archived documents, a scoping literature review, and an examination of past surveillance assessments and evaluation reports.

Results: The review of archived documents revealed key historical events that have shaped the surveillance system. These include the establishment of the Directorate of Veterinary Services in 1895, advancements in livestock farming, the implementation of mandatory disease control interventions in 1944, the growth of veterinary services from a section to a ministry in 1954, the disruption caused by the Mau Mau insurrection from 1952 to 1954, which led to the temporary halt of agriculture in certain regions until 1955, the transition of veterinary clinical services from public to private, and the progressive privatization plan for veterinary services starting in 1976. Additionally, we highlight the development of electronic surveillance from 2003 to 2024. The scoping literature review, assessments and evaluation reports uncovered several strengths and weaknesses of the surveillance system. Among the strengths are a robust legislative framework, the adoption of technology in surveillance practices, the existence of a formal intersectoral coordination platform, the implementation of syndromic, sentinel, and community-based surveillance methods, and the presence of a feedback mechanism. On the other hand, the systemâ€™s weaknesses include the inadequate implementation of strategies and enforcement of laws, the lack of standard case definitions for priority diseases, underutilization of laboratory services, the absence of formal mechanisms for data sharing across sectors, insufficient resources for surveillance and response, limited integration of surveillance and laboratory systems, inadequate involvement of private actors and communities in disease surveillance, and the absence of a direct supervisory role between the national and county veterinary services.

Discussion and recommendations: To establish an effective early warning system, we propose the integration of surveillance systems and the establishment of formal data sharing mechanisms. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing technological advancements and adopting ai in surveillance practices, as well as implementing risk-based surveillance to optimize the allocation of surveillance resources.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/145385

The Tataouine, Kebili and Medenine Governorates in southern Tunisia have a temperate desert climate, with annual rainfall of 100-200 mm/yr at ~100 m elevation, and livelihoods depend on livestock fed on forage from communal rangelands and purchased feeds. The restoration approach used was short-duration, high-stocking-rate opportunistic grazing.

Zaghouan Governorate is in the agrosilvopastoral region of northern Tunisia with annual rainfall of 400 mm/yr at ~200 m elevation, and where agriculture depends on olives and small ruminants on private croplands and state-owned rangelands, including Sbaihia. The restoration approach used was silvopastoral enriched seasonal exclosure.

Climate change, increasing livestock densities, complex land tenure systems, and rangeland fragmentation are key factors contributing to rangeland degradation. The dismantling of Tunisiaâ€™s traditional grazing practices, Gdel, has further exacerbated the problem.

East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania)

The rangelands of southern Ethiopia (Borana Zone in Oromia Region, southern Somali Region) and northern Kenya (here Baringo, Isiolo, and Marsabit Counties) vary from tropical semi-arid savanna rangelands (350-700 mm/yr at 300-1,700 m elevation), to hot tropical arid desert and semi-desert rangelands (100-350 mm/yr at 200-600 m elevation). Bi-modal annual rainfall is divided among two rainy and two dry seasons each year.

The rangelands of northern Tanzania (here, Kiteto District) have a tropical semi-arid savanna climate, with rainfall of approximately 700 mm/yr annually, at approximately 1,300 m elevation in Kiteto. The uni-modal rainfall in the area means that all rainfall comes in one season, with a single dry season in the remainder of the year.

The restoration approach used was short-resting of 1-6 months, usually in combination with control of problematic and/or invasive plant species.

These rangelands are communal, use and management of which is overseen by local or traditional rangeland management institutions. Livelihoods focus on extensive household milk production, with occasional sales of live animals and products. Farming of annual crops is higher in semi-arid rangelands, especially in uni-modal areas of Tanzania, while arid zones have little farming. Rangeland degradation in East Africa is primarily the result of droughts caused by climate change, weak communal land tenure security, weak local institutional oversight leading to disorganized and heavy grazing, and rangeland fragmentation.

Colombia

The Orinoquia region of Colombia has a tropical humid forest climate, receiving annual rainfall of 2,000-3,000 mm/yr, at 100-200 m elevation. Hacienda San JosÃ© in Vichada is a private ranch in the Orinoquia managed for beef production, with rainfall of ~2,500 mm/yr at ~100 m elevation. The restoration approach used was rotational grazing with managed spontaneous tree regeneration.

Degraded landscapes in the Orinoquia need effective solutions to minimize the impacts of overgrazing and restore cover of native forest trees, leading to the development of monitoring methods using remote sensing and ai (ai) that can track tree cover, aboveground biomass, and soil carbon over private ranches such as Hacienda San JosÃ© at 9,000 ha.","Control of problematic and invasive species includes transaction costs, from 'social fencing' and organizing contributions of labor and other inputs, while brief resting (e.g., 4 months over year 1) will have low opportunity costs.",Rotational grazing is being implemented as a practical approach to restore degraded pastures.,"Vegetation recovery is supported, overgrazing is avoided, and soil health is improved through increased root biomass, organic matter, and microbial activity while reducing compaction and erosion.",restoration;grazing lands;climate crisis;bush encroachment;rangelands,"This publication outlines the efforts of One CGIAR researchers and partners in restoring grazing lands in various regions of Africa, focusing on sustainable management strategies to combat challenges like bush encroachment and rangeland degradation amidst a climate crisis.

These threats include emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), jeopardised food safety and security, freshwater scarcity, climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. These pressing health and sustainability challenges exceed the scope of any single discipline, government ministry, or societal sector, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and multisectoral collaboration, as well as for a socioecologically oriented systems perspective that appreciates the fundamental interconnections between humans, other animals, and the wider ecosystem.

When this Commission first convened in 2019, One Health was a highly visible, but also greatly evolving, concept and approach. Predominantly driven by the veterinary sector, the primary focus of One Health in early years had been on zoonotic diseases, but more recent years have seen an increasingly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary expansion and diversification of the concept, a proliferation of initiatives, and growing concerns about fragmentation and insufficient conceptual clarity. There was a need to advance not only conceptual expansion, but also consensus, as well as aligned, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and multisectoral efforts towards One Health operationalisation, implementation, and institutionalisation. We set out to address these needs and leverage One Health as a crucial and viable approach to achieving equitable, sustainable, and healthy socioecological systemsâ€”the vision of the <i>Lancet</i> One Health Commission. The zoonotic underpinnings of the COVID-19 pandemic and its wide-ranging effects across sectors necessitated a radical rethink of the role of One Health in pursuing sustainable development and substantially shaped the importance and trajectories of the Commission's work.

The Commission's methodology entailed convening a diverse, transnational, and interdisciplinary group of experts, who conducted an informed synthesis and appraisal of the current state of knowledge and evidence regarding the need for and value of One Health, which resulted in the proposal of key avenues for One Health operationalisation, implementation, and institutionalisation. We build on new and evolving One Health advances, including the One Health Joint Plan of Action, launched by the One Health Quadripartite, and the definition of One Health, One Health principles, and theory of change put forth by the One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP).

This Commission is guided by a One Health ethos comprising principles of holism and systems thinking, epistemological pluralism, equity and egalitarianism, and stewardship and sustainability. The Commission also engages a socioecological systems perspective that sheds light on the crucial importance of the environment, including plants, soil, water, air, wilDLife, biodiversity, and climate.

Despite this significant contribution, it is predominantly comprised smallholder farmers with few cows providing vital support in terms of food security, household income and employment for millions of farmers. Research aimed at enhancing productivity and sustainability in these smallholder dairy systems is crucial for rural development, increasing farm incomes, creating employment and supporting women and youth. However, a major challenge is the absence of a routine performance data collection system. Previous efforts to address this limitation often relied on methods from well-established dairy systems in developed countries which frequently failed to adapt effectively. Advances in mobile technology have prompted attempts to investigate alternative cost-effective and practical data recording systems in the smallholder dairy farming with a major focus on information and communications technology (ICT). Successful implementation of digital tools for data collection and synthesis to generate management information as feedback to farmers using ICT-based extension tools has led to increased productivity and household income.

3. Trends in livestock demand and supply under climate change are likely to become more uncertain and equity and productivity gaps are likely to intensify in the coming decades. Although industrialised systems can better invest in the feed and adaptations and mitigation measures needed under climate change than smallholdersâ€™ systems, livestock are critical for smallholdersâ€™ livelihoods and food security, and we need to anticipate the wider range of interventions that may be needed to increase resilience in such systems.
4. Future livestock and climate development needs to be planned and implemented in a cross-sectoral way. The multi-dimensional importance of livestock to the livelihoods of at least 1.3 billion people globally has not yet been reflected in development or climate assistance, research focus or the data landscape.

7. Institutional, policy and technological opportunities for increasing livestock farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity include preserving livestock mobility traditions in pastoral lands;assistance with destocking and restocking before and after drought;developing new product markets to satisfy consumer demand;promoting wider use of index-based insurance products and other risk transfer mechanisms;and enhancing farmersâ€™ effective use of extension information using social media and digital platforms.

But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania in-dependently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmersâ€™information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2â€“4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific â€œtop 3â€ options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmersâ€™preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48â€“68%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from farmers, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.","to what extent a household-tailored advisory application increases adoption and continued use of promoted practices, compared to more â€œone-size-ï¬ts-allâ€ approaches to agricultural advisory",automated call-in hotline connected to a database of audio records,resource-efficient strategies of engaging ICT in agricultural extension,agriculture;advisory;ICT;digital solutions;farmers,This research examines the feasibility of delivering individually targeted agricultural information to diverse households through an automated call-in hotline.

Milk production has increased steadily from 0.4 to 3.1 billion litres per year and Uganda has changed from a net importer to a net exporter of milk and dairy products. However, domestic milk consumption the per capita consumption of 60 litres per year is still only 33% of that recommended by WHO. Progress in Ugandaâ€™s dairy sector development is a result of persistent and concerted action by public and private sectors. Notably;(1) the legislative, regulatory instruments and institutions, particularly the establishment of the pivotal DDA;(2) development actions by Send-a-Cow, Heifer International, and more recently SNV especially in the small-scale producer space;(3) research and development actions by CGIAR (ILRI and IFPRI), especially through the East African Dairy Development (EADD), and East African Dairy Genetics (EADG) projects, and (4) investments by the private sector in milk processing e.g. Jesa Farms Limited. Many other local and international actors have played a role, not least the farmers who have taken the risk to venture into dairy production amidst the many challenges. Further and accelerated growth is required to meet increasing domestic and regional demand for milk. Interventions to accelerate milk production should aim to increase farm productivity by strengthening producer organizations, improving farm business processes;and by the extending dairy investments beyond the southwestern and central Uganda milksheds. The sector has to over-come key challenges notably:
1. Inequities in the dairy value chain;low farm-gate price of milk amid increasing cost of production is cited as single most important indicator of inequity.
2. Gaps in the knowledge, skills and workmanship of the human resources along the value chain which in part contributes to inefficiency and low productivity reduces r competitiveness.
3. Adaptation to sustainable practices to mitigate climate change and constraints on natural esources.

1. Structure, strengths, weakness opportunities and threat of the Uganda dairy value chain
2. Recent Dairy Development Initiatives and Investments.
3. Review of the role of Dairy cooperatives.

The study was performed a critical review of published literature and interview of 20 key informants involved different aspects of the dairy value chain including famers, researchers, regulators, breeders and processors. The salient results of the study are:
1. Producer organizations (e.g. cooperatives, associations) are considered as a key approach to one of empowering producers. The most common service offered by these organizations is bulking of milk from producers and offering lines of credit to the members. Some producer organizations are venturing into processing of raw milk and are vehicles for acquisition of extension and technical services, appropriate inputs, high capital equipment and machinery. However, it is argued that cooperatives/producer organizations are not exploiting their full potential because they are weak and poorly governed.
;The dairy industry in Uganda has grown remarkably over the past two decades. Milk production has increased steadily from 0.4 to 3.1 billion litres per year and Uganda has changed from a net importer to a net exporter of milk and dairy products. However, domestic milk consumption the per capita consumption of 60 litres per year is still only 33% of that recommended by WHO. Progress in Ugandaâ€™s dairy sector development is a result of persistent and concerted action by public and private sectors. Notably;(1) the legislative, regulatory instruments and institutions, particularly the establishment of the pivotal DDA;(2) development actions by Send-a-Cow, Heifer International, and more recently SNV especially in the small-scale producer space;(3) research and development actions by CGIAR (ILRI and IFPRI), especially through the East African Dairy Development (EADD), and East African Dairy Genetics (EADG) projects, and (4) investments by the private sector in milk processing e.g. Jesa Farms Limited. Many other local and international actors have played a role, not least the farmers who have taken the risk to venture into dairy production amidst the many challenges. Further and accelerated growth is required to meet increasing domestic and regional demand for milk. Interventions to accelerate milk production should aim to increase farm productivity by strengthening producer organizations, improving farm business processes;and by the extending dairy investments beyond the southwestern and central Uganda milksheds. The sector has to over-come key challenges notably:
1. Inequities in the dairy value chain;low farm-gate price of milk amid increasing cost of production is cited as single most important indicator of inequity.
2. Gaps in the knowledge, skills and workmanship of the human resources along the value chain which in part contributes to inefficiency and low productivity reduces r competitiveness.
3. Adaptation to sustainable practices to mitigate climate change and constraints on natural esources.
This study reviews the Uganda dairy industry addressing the following seven topics.
1. Structure, strengths, weakness opportunities and threat of the Uganda dairy value chain
2. Recent Dairy Development Initiatives and Investments.
3. Review of the role of Dairy cooperatives.
4. The Role of ICT (including Digital Solutions) in Uganda Dairy Production

C.",Eliza Harris,eliza.harris@unibe.ch,No Data,Abstract,ML,No Data,Climate adaptation & mitigation,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas emitted during soil nitrogen cycling. Excess nitrogen fertilization leads to increased N2O emissions, which is a waste of applied nitrogen. Optimized nitrogen fertilizer management (4R nutrient management:  right product, right rate, right time, right method/place)  can enhance nitrogen use efficiency and reduce N2O emissions without reducing crop yields, mitigating the climate impact of agriculture. This is particularly relevant in developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa where fertilizer use is expected to increase over coming decades. Effective fertilizer management offers multiple benefits: Boosting food security while safeguarding the environment and minimizing input costs for farmers.

Quantifying N2O emissions at the field and farm level is challenging. Therefore, N2O is often not included in agroecosystem assessments, which may focus on variables such as the CO2 budget or soil carbon balance. Typical methods to quantify N2O fluxes â€“ such as automated chamber measurements and eddy covariance â€“ are expensive and require advanced knowledge and infrastructure. Moreover, N2O emissions are highly heterogeneous in space and time, thus many measurements are needed to quantify emissions. Novel measurements, models and ML can be used in combination with existing techniques to understand drivers, increase spatial coverage, and extrapolate to new locations.

Measurement innovations focusing on low-cost sensing of N2O will provide much needed data in remote and developing regions. Low-cost sensing is particularly suited in direct soil gas measurements, where N2O concentrations and variability are much higher than in free air. Specialised algorithms are needed to estimate fluxes based on soil gas measurements. ML and process modelling approaches can furthermore be used to understand drivers and create simple simulations of N2O emissions, to extrapolate in space and time based on existing (sparse) measurements. These approaches can also leverage proxies, such as isotopic composition, to estimate emissions. Measurement campaigns in data-poor regions should prioritise calibration, collection of ancillary data (such as soil moisture, temperature and nitrogen content), robust metadata reporting, and open data sharing, to maximise the impact of measurements and facilitate data-driven analyses. Development of these tools and approaches will allow N2O emissions to be estimated for different sites and scenarios, opening the way for simple emission accounting and the inclusion of N2O in agroecosystem assessments.","Excess nitrogen fertilization leads to increased N2O emissions, which is a waste of applied nitrogen.","Optimized nitrogen fertilizer management (4R nutrient management: right product, right rate, right time, right method/place).",Boosting food security while safeguarding the environment and minimizing input costs for farmers.,nitrous oxide;greenhouse gas;nitrogen use efficiency;ML;developing regions,"This publication discusses the challenges and solutions for quantifying nitrous oxide emissions in data-poor regions, emphasizing the importance of optimized nitrogen fertilizer management.

The disease mainly affects livestock and people. It has been listed by the World Health Organization as one of the nine diseases that has the potential to cause pandemics. RVF outbreaks are often sudden and intense, typically occurring after prolonged periods of heavy rainfall. These events are challenging to predict with sufficient lead time due to their rapid onset and progression. For instance, during the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak in East Africa, an early warning was issued in mid-September 2006, but a comprehensive warning only came in November 2006, by which time initial cases had already been reported. These delays in forecasting, combined with inadequate surveillance systems, have hindered the ability of public and animal health authorities to implement effective response measures. Post-outbreak assessments conducted in Kenya revealed that the epidemic's severity was aggravated by delays in recognizing the risks and taking preventive and control actions. The evaluations further highlighted the absence of a documented contingency or emergency plan for RVF, as well as the lack of pre-allocated emergency funds, especially in the livestock sector. These challenges underscored the need to refine contingency plans and led to the development of the RVF Decision Support Tool (DST) to enhance preparedness and guide responses to future epidemics.

Through harvesting we identified 5,487 journal articles matching the inclusion criteria in CGIAR repositories:

- Issue date between 2012 and 2023
- The words climate change in the title, abstract, or keywords
- English language
- DOI assigned

The bibliographic metadata was merged and normalized to ensure consistent use of date formats, multi-value separators, and identifiers. The ETL pipeline used titles and DOIs to identify and remove duplicates, as well as exclude any others that had been erroneously included due to incorrect repository metadata we could identify (mislabeled preprints, non-English, etc.). We used Crossref, Unpaywall, and OpenAlex to fill in gaps for missing metadata such as usage (license) and access rights, affiliations, and publishers because this information can be valuable to researchers. Minor normalization was performed on affiliations, countries, and publishers, but all other metadata was used as-is from the respective repositories.

4,495 journal articles were uploaded to the Rayyan platform for a blinded screening of climate change relevance by a team trained in systematic literature review methodology. Reviewers excluded journal articles not deemed to be climate change related or identified as further duplicates.

Introducing commercial breeds usually results in lower productivity than expected, as a result of unfavourable genotype by environment interaction. It is difficult to predict of how these commercial breeds will perform in different conditions encountered in e.g. sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we present a novel methodology to model performance, by using growth data from different chicken breeds that were tested in Ethiopia. The suitability of these commercial breeds was tested by predicting the response of body weight as a function of the environment across Ethiopia. Phenotype distribution models were built using ML algorithms to make predictions of weight in the local environmental conditions based on the productivity for the breed. Based on the predicted body weight, breeds were assigned as being most suitable in a given agro-ecology or region. We identified the most important environmental variables that explained the variation in body weight across agro-ecologies for each of the breeds. Our results highlight the importance of acknowledging the role of environment in predicting productivity in scavenging chicken production systems.

A-WENI contains a small subset of WENI indicators identified using ML with South Asian data and therefore is context-specific. CC-WENI does not contain indicators specific to the validation context. We find that they perform comparably well with caveats. Thus, as use of WENI expands we recommend adapting WENI for in-depth analyses of women's nutritional empowerment;using CC-WENI for cross-context comparisons;and using A-WENI for rapid appraisals of community level progress in a given context.;and using A-WENI for rapid appraisals of community level progress in a given context.;using CC-WENI for cross-context comparisons",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/163367

Existing approaches to livestock carrying capacity often rely on either localized ground surveys, which are insufficient for capturing the spatial variability and dynamic responses of rangelands at regional scales, or on process-based models, which require extensive calibration and are often unsuitable for data-scarce regions such as East Africa. Here, we address this gap by developing a novel ML-based approach that integrates remote sensing-derived biomass data with climate projections to estimate future changes in livestock carrying capacity and to diagnose their primary drivers. Our results project substantial declines in carrying capacity, particularly across mixed crop-livestock rainfed temperate systems. For example, reductions of up to 37% in tropical livestock units (TLU) are projected in Ethiopiaâ€™s dominant mixed crop-livestock rainfed temperate system, while Kenya is expected to experience up to a 24% reduction in the same production system, alongside moderate declines in Uganda. Modest increases are projected for some production systems, especially in parts of Uganda and Kenya. The main climatic drivers underlying the projected declines include increased precipitation during the wettest quarter, decreased temperature seasonality, and increased temperature during the driest quarter. Our findings highlight the urgency of implementing tailored adaptation strategies in the mixed crop-livestock rainfed temperate systems, especially in Ethiopia, with a focus on strengthening monitoring systems. Simultaneously, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya should capitalize on projected increases in carrying capacity, promoting sustainable productivity growth while prioritizing low-emissions livestock development.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/176089

We analysed antibiotic use practices among smallholder-intensive poultry farms in Kenya and characterised access to veterinary supply chains by calculating travel time to drug stores.

Data were collected from 766 poultry farms across 15 Kenyan counties, representing all production types, between May 2021 and February 2022. We also collected antibiotic sales and geolocation data from 321 veterinary drug stores in Nakuru and Kilifi counties, representing areas with high and low-intensity poultry production, respectively. Using a ML framework, we predicted farm-level antibiotic use based on collected demographic and production traits. We also built geospatial models to characterise farmer travel time to drug stores with motorised transport.

Half of farms used antibiotics at least once in the last two months, mostly for self-administered therapeutic reasons. Random forest analysis predicted that farms using disinfectants in cleaning, keeping other poultry species, with rodents in the chicken house and vaccinating their birds had the highest likelihood of antibiotic use. 95.4â€¯% of farmers lived within one hour of a veterinary drug store, with 40â€¯% residing within 15â€¯min.

Antibiotic use is integrated in smallholder poultry production, emphasising the need for prioritizing biosecurity, regulatory and socio-behavioural interventions, and economic incentives to enhance stewardship.

This will require instantaneous access to information on food-source quality at key points of agri-food systems. Although laboratory analysis and benchtop NIR spectrometers are regularly used to quantify grain quality, these do not suit all end users, for example, stakeholders in decentralized agri-food chains that are typical in emerging economies. Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel ML (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R2 â‰¥ 0.90, RMSE â‰¤ 0.91, RPD â‰¥ 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48).

Spatio-temporal fields of landâ€“atmosphere fluxes derived from data-driven models can complement simulations by process-based land surface models. While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 ML (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and Other ai Method splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2 < 0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2 > 0.6), gross primary production (R2> 0.7), latent heat (R2 > 0.7), sensible heat (R2 > 0.7), and net radiation (R2 > 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2 > 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2 < 0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics).

A wealth of studies have assessed biotic responses to urbanization in North America and Europe, but there is little empirical evidence that directly links human activities to urban biodiversity in the tropics. Results from a largeâ€scale field study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya, are used to explore the impact of human activities on the biodiversity of wilDLife and livestock with which humans coâ€exist across the city. The structure of sympatric wilDLife, livestock and human populations are characterized using unsupervised ML, and statistical modelling is used to relate compositional variation in these communities to socioâ€ecological drivers occurring across the city. By characterizing landscapeâ€scale drivers acting on these interfaces, we demonstrate that socioeconomics, elevation and subsequent changes in habitat have measurable impacts upon the diversity, density and species assemblage of wilDLife, livestock and humans. Restructuring of wilDLife and livestock assemblages (both in terms of species diversity and composition) has important implications for the emergence of novel diseases at urban interfaces, and we therefore use our results to generate a set of testable hypotheses that explore the influence of urban change on microbial communities. These results provide novel insight into the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the tropics.

Hence, the five-day workshop agenda was designed to satisfy the needs of meteorologists, hydrologists, and researchers by providing both theoretical and hands-on skills related to WRFHydro modeling. Accordingly, the rationale behind WRF-Hydro as a tool against existing regional hydrological challenges was presented and discussed. This was based on a foundation of basic principles of physical hydrology to help participants learn more advanced modeling techniques. Such discussions covered an overview of WRF-Hydro applications worldwide, Linux for preparing the model environment, and in-depth WRF-Hydro modeling. Later, greater emphasis was placed on hands-on training in model execution, evaluation, and calibration to turn theoretical knowledge into practice. Participants were taken through practical exercises involving preparing model domains using the WRF Pre-processing System (WPS), pre-processing Geographic Information System (GIS) terrain data, and preparing compulsory forcing data for running WRF-Hydro simulations. The last session was used to present the case studies, share experiences, and possibly collaborate on new ideas. By the end of the training, participants had the tools and expertise to apply WRF-Hydro in their operations, particularly flood and stream flow forecasting, to support improved water resource management and enhanced climate resilience.

The African dairy cattle genetic gains (ADGG) program is a collaborative effort of International Livestock Research Institute, Livestock Development Institute, and other national and international partners to foster sustainable genetic improvement. The ADGG program has developed and implemented digital herd performance recording tools, national dairy recording platforms, digital extension services, and genomic evaluation pipelines for Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia. The initial programâ€™s target was to register 12,000 dairy herds in each country, however in Ethiopiaâ€™s in 98 districts and 6 regions, more than 74,500 herds and 157,000 animals had been registered by July 2022. The volume and diversity of data being captured by national dairy database is steadily growing. For example, today 440,000 test-day milk yield and 313,000 body weight records have been captured. The above data has been used to undertake the first genomic evaluations, results of which have been publicized in the national Cow and Bull Catalogue for the locally bred but genetically superior bulls and cows. Three of the top ranked bulls have been recruited into the National Artificial Insemination (ai) center for broader use nationally. So far, a total of 67,000 semen straws have been extracted from these bulls and are being used to breed cows and heifers in 14 districts of Ethiopia, thereby not only benefiting many local smallholder dairy farmers, but also significantly saving the country foreign exchange which would otherwise have been used to import bulls and semen from outside the country most of bulls may not be as locally adapted and genetically superior. The great achievement has been realized due to existence of systematic animal identification and consistent performance recording, both of which are crucial for sustained national genetic evaluation, identification, and use of genetically superior and locally adapted dairy breeding stock. Furthermore, identifying roles and responsibilities, and strengthening collaboration among key dairy actors and strong government leadership and support are mandatory to build sustainable breeding program.",A sustainable breeding program cannot be realized without full engagement of all dairy actors in the value chain.,Adopting and integrating digital tools and genomic technology boost the genetic gains.,Improving the livelihood of many smallholder farmers.,dairy;genomic prediction;Ethiopia;livestock;agriculture,"The paper discusses the importance of cooperatives and the role of local and international development partners in promoting dairy genetic improvement in Ethiopia.

Mostly, positive deviants are identified subjectively, introducing bias and limiting generalisation. The aim of the study was to objectively identify positive deviant farms using the Pareto-optimality ranking technique in a sample of smallholder dairy farms under contrasting stressful environments in Tanzania to test the hypothesis that positive deviant farms that simultaneously outperform typical farms in multiple performance indicators also outperform in yield gap, productivity and livelihood benefits. The selection criteria set five performance indicators: energy balance â‰¥ 0.35 Mcal NEL/d, disease-incidence density â‰¤ 12.75 per 100 animal-years at risk, daily milk yield â‰¥ 6.32 L/cow/day, age at first calving â‰¤ 1153.28 days and calving interval â‰¤ 633.68 days. Findings proved the hypothesis. A few farms (27: 3.4%) emerged as positive deviants, outperforming typical farms in yield gap, productivity and livelihood benefits. The estimated yield gap in typical farms was 76.88% under low-stress environments and 48.04% under high-stress environments. On average, total cash income, gross margins and total benefits in dairy farming were higher in positive deviants than in typical farms in both low- and high-stress environments. These results show that the Pareto-optimality ranking technique applied in a large population objectively identified a few positive deviant farms that attained higher productivity and livelihood benefits in both low- and high-stress environments. However, positive deviants invested more in inputs.

By leveraging mobile technology and a centralized database, the SNS has streaMLined the Rwandan governmentâ€™s subsidy allocation process, enabling over 1.9 million farmers to access essential inputs like fertilizers and seeds. The systemâ€™s real-time data tracking, farmer empowerment tools, and market development initiatives have fostered transparency, efficiency, and inclusivity in the agricultural sector. Despite its successes, the SNS faces challenges in areas such as digital supply chain management, financial processes, and user experience. These challenges highlight the need for continuous improvement and adaptation to ensure the systemâ€™s long-term sustainability and effectiveness. The â€œSynchronized Scaling of Digital Fertilizer Advisory for Six Crops through Rwandaâ€™s Smart Nkunganire Systemâ€ project under the CGIAR Research Initiative Diversification for Resilient Agrifood Systems in East and Southern Africa (Ukama Ustawi) and Excellence in Agronomy (EiA) both supported by CGIAR led by International Potato Center (CIP) and other partners, aimed to address these challenges and explore optimal delivery/business models for the next phase of the SNSâ€™s development.
The assessment of various delivery/business models revealed that the SNS currently aligns most strongly with the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Mobile-First approaches. The PPP model has been instrumental in the systemâ€™s successful implementation, while the mobile-first design has enhanced its accessibility and reach. However, there is potential for the SNS to evolve further by incorporating elements of other models, such as tiered services and data monetization, to create a more personalized and impactful experience for farmers.
The future of the SNS is promising. By addressing existing challenges, leveraging its data-driven insights, and exploring innovative business models, the SNS can continue to empower farmers, drive agricultural transformation, and contribute to Rwandaâ€™s food security and economic growth.

This study examines the combined impacts of climate change and soil acidity on future crop potential, focusing on Ethiopia as a case study. The EcoCrop crop suitability model was parameterized and run for four key food crops in Ethiopia (teff, maize, barley and common wheat), under current and mid-century climate conditions. To assess the impacts of soil acidification on crop suitability, a simulation study was conducted by lowering the soil pH values by 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 and re-running the suitability model, comparing the changes in the area suitable for each crop. Our evaluation of the model, by comparing the modeled suitable areas with reference data, indicated that there was a good fit for all the four crops. Using default soil pH values, we project that there will be no significant changes in the suitability of maize, barley and wheat and an increase in the suitability of teff by the mid-century, as influenced by projected increases in rainfall in the country. Our results demonstrate a direct relationship between the lowering of soil pH and increasing losses in the area suitable for all crops, but especially for teff, barley and wheat.

There is limited information on how catena features can be used to refine fertiliser recommendations in the undulating landscapes of the east African highlands.

aims
(1) Determine the effects of landscape positions and soil types on crop-nutrient responses, and rainwater productivity (RWP);and (2) identify wheat yield-limiting nutrients across landscape positions.

Methods
Two sets of on-farm nutrient management experiments with wheat were conducted on foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions over 71 sites in 2016 and 2019. The first experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, Regosols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5, K2O, and SO4. The second experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5 and Zn.

Key results
NP increased yield across landscape positions. NP Ã— K and NP Ã— S interactions increased total biomass by 5â€“76%. Zinc Ã— soil type interaction increased total biomass on Vertisols (6%) and Cambisols (9%), but increasing Zn did not improve yield on Nitisols. Zinc Ã— landscape position interaction increased total biomass at foot slope (2%) and mid-slope (13%) positions. Zinc Ã— NP interaction increased biomass yield on Cambisols, Nitisols, and Vertisols. N138P69 significantly increased RWP at foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions. Soil nutrient and water contents decreased with increasing slope regarDLess of nutrient source and application rate.

A Pettitt test identified 1987 as a significant change point (p < 0.0001), indicating a structural shift in the agricultural production system. The study employs interrupted time series and ML models, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), interrupted ARIMA, artificial neural network (ann), and interrupted ann, to forecast key food grains such as rice, wheat, coarse cereals, total cereals, pulses, and total food grains. The intervention effect was significant for most commodities, with 1987 coded as 1 and other years as 0. The interrupted models particularly interrupted ann, achieved superior accuracy in both training and testing datasets and the highest error reductions, with up to 96.45% for pulses and 99.06% for total food grains in the training dataset and 99.05% for pulses and 91.45% for total food grains in the testing dataset. Despite a negative production effect in 1987, the overall trend remained positive, with average annual production increases of 14.54, 15.28, 3.73, 33.65, 1.63, and 35.18 lakh tons for rice, wheat, coarse cereals, total cereals, pulses, and total food grains, respectively. While interrupted ARIMA models capture linear patterns, they often fail to address nonlinearities. This study addresses this gap by developing interrupted ann models to capture nonlinearities in Indian food grain production data. This approach offers valuable insights into addressing structural shifts in agricultural systems, improving production forecasting, and supporting evidence-based policy-making in developing economies.","The intervention effect was significant for most commodities, modeled as a dummy variable (1987â€‰=â€‰1 and all other years as 0).

Acoustic detection can directly identify the cause of damage (i.e., insects) in stored grains rather than the effect (e.g., RH, temperature) and it is capable of hanDLing high information density due to the broad frequency band and the different sound levels. This research addresses the question if the use of micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) microphone can detect insect sound in stored grains, predict insectsâ€™ presence and classify insects according to species with the application of a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm.
We adapted the acoustic sensor from the Smart Apiculture Management Services (SAMS) project using the Adafruit SPH0645, an inexpensive MEMS microphone that was used to detect insect pests in stored rice grain.

Applications of digital innovations include faster and more reliable communication, better collection, analysis, and storage of data, enhancing democratic processes and transparency in governance, affordable financial services and can provide the basis for decision support. However, there is a risk that people with less formal education and skills and little resource endowments as well as particular groups of people such as women will be excluded from participating or benefiting from digital innovation, the so-called digital divide.

In Southeast Asian countries, rice production is responsible for a larger amount of GHG emissions than livestock or other crops, and the highest share of Methane, a gas 28 times more potent than Carbon dioxide in global warming potential (https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/nonco2/).
Governments have announced strong commitments to reduce emissions across sectors, reflected in their NDCs, Net-Zero targets, and the Methane Pledge. However, the share of countries that have quantified mitigation actions in the rice sector is significantly low, at 17 among the 164 nations that have submitted new and updated NDCs by November 2022 (Vu et al., 2022). Having an MRV system to structurally and consistently track GHG emissions from rice cultivation activities is essential for nations to determine baseline emissions and set achievable mitigation targets, as well as to monitor progress. It will also provide reliable evidence for policymaking and the verification of reductions for climate finance purposes.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most widely used form of molecular genetic variation studies. As reference genomes and resequencing data sets expand exponentially, tools must be in place to call SNPs at a similar pace. The genome analysis toolkit (GATK) is one of the most widely used SNP calling software tools publicly available, but unfortunately, high-performance computing versions of this tool have yet to become widely available and affordable.

Results
Here we report an open-source high-performance computing genome variant calling workflow (HPC-GVCW) for GATK that can run on multiple computing platforms from supercomputers to desktop machines. We benchmarked HPC-GVCW on multiple crop species for performance and accuracy with comparable results with previously published reports (using GATK alone). Finally, we used HPC-GVCW in production mode to call SNPs on a â€œsubpopulation awareâ€ 16-genome rice reference panel with ~ 3000 resequenced rice accessions. The entire process took ~ 16 weeks and resulted in the identification of an average of 27.3 M SNPs/genome and the discovery of ~ 2.3 million novel SNPs that were not present in the flagship reference genome for rice (i.e., IRGSP RefSeq).

Conclusions
This study developed an open-source pipeline (HPC-GVCW) to run GATK on HPC platforms, which significantly improved the speed at which SNPs can be called. The workflow is widely applicable as demonstrated successfully for four major crop species with genomes ranging in size from 400 Mb to 2.4 Gb. Using HPC-GVCW in production mode to call SNPs on a 25 multi-crop-reference genome data set produced over 1.1 billion SNPs that were publicly released for functional and breeding studies. For rice, many novel SNPs were identified and were found to reside within genes and open chromatin regions that are predicted to have functional consequences. Combined, our results demonstrate the usefulness of combining a high-performance SNP calling architecture solution with a subpopulation-aware reference genome panel for rapid SNP discovery and public deployment.",to improve food security by accelerating the genetic improvement of major crop species,integrate 'DeepVariant' into our HPC workflow to discover and explore new uncharacterized variation,Such pan-genome analyses may also reveal new variants that could provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of flooding tolerance.,genetic variation;genetic improvement;crops;food security;ML,"We developed HPC-GVCW, a high-performance computing pipeline for calling genetic variation in major crops that significantly reduces execution times.

During ripening stage and at harvest, over 22,000 digital images were captured vertically downward over the rice canopy from a distance of 0.8 to 0.9 m at 4,820 harvesting plots having the yield of 0.1 to 16.1 tÂ·haâˆ’1 across 6 countries in Africa and Japan. A convolutional neural network applied to these data at harvest predicted 68% variation in yield with a relative root mean square error of 0.22. The developed model successfully detected genotypic difference and impact of agronomic interventions on yield in the independent dataset. The model also demonstrated robustness against the images acquired at different shooting angles up to 30Â° from right angle, diverse light environments, and shooting date during late ripening stage. Even when the resolution of images was reduced (from 0.2 to 3.2 cmÂ·pixelâˆ’1 of ground sampling distance), the model could predict 57% variation in yield, implying that this approach can be scaled by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles. Our work offers low-cost, hands-on, and rapid approach for high-throughput phenotyping and can lead to impact assessment of productivity-enhancing interventions, detection of fields where these are needed to sustainably increase crop production, and yield forecast at several weeks before harvesting.",sustainably increase crop production,CNN model for yield estimation,"yield forecasting has great potential benefits in terms of field management, marketing, distribution, and policy decisions",agriculture;sustainability;crop production,"This study, supported by various funding sources, focuses on productivity-enhancing interventions in rice-based farming systems aimed at sustainably increasing crop production.",https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/132700

The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and development partners took measures to prevent the spread of the virus and keep the agriculture and food systems running, and farmers and communities adopted local techniques as resilience measures to adapt to and lessen the effect of the virus. This review attempts to synthesize the knowledge on impacts of COVID-19 on Bangladesh agriculture and food systems, and document government's and development partners' policy responses and measures to COVID-19 to mitigate the impacts and farmers' coping strategies as effective resilience measures. The aim here is to provide a comprehensive picture of impacts and policy lessons to the Bangladesh government and development partners to effectively manage any future pandemics such as COVID-19 in the country and in developing countries of Asia. The core lesson is that agriculture needs a transformation to technology intensive (both digital and non-digital), efficient supply chains (i.e., shorter value chains), mechanization, farmer organizations led, and consumer connected (e.g., online platforms and direct marketing channels) with various kinds of resilience measures, including information sharing systems, financial mechanisms and social safety nets.

Couch causes significant yield losses in rice production globally. This research study was conducted develop, verify, and validate a mechanistic rice blast simulation model using STELLA 9.1 modeling software based on the structure of the EPIRICE model developed at IRRI. A leaf blast submodel was coupled to the neck blast submodel using the leaf and neck blast relationship based on a linear Other ai Method equation. The model was developed and verified using leaf and neck blast data from eight verification sites and validated in five sites in the Philippines. In general, graphical comparison showed similar shapes of simulated and observed leaf blast severity and neck blast incidence progress curves. Statistical validation of the model used the Wilcoxon test, Root mean square error (RMSE), and equivalence test. The RMSE test indicated satisfactory results, showing low values for leaf blast severity and approximately twice as high values for neck blast incidence. The Wilcoxon test showed significant differences between observed and simulated leaf blast severities at all validation sites and 60% accuracy in predicting neck blast. On the other hand, the equivalence test showed 40% accuracy in predicting leaf blast severity and 40% accuracy in predicting neck blast incidence. Inconsistencies in the statistical tests can be due to the complexity and differences in the leaf and neck blast pathosystems. Potential leaf blast epidemics were mapped in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines using projected weather data generated by the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) Coupled Model for the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) of International Panel for Climate under two climate scenarios.

Limited knowledge transfer on climateâ€resilient varieties has led farmers to favor traditional cultivars over newer ones. Headâ€toâ€Head Adaptive Trials (HHATs) were introduced to promote the dissemination of improved varieties, but their effectiveness has not been fully assessed. This study evaluates farmers' trait preferences, varietal selection criteria, adoption patterns, key determinants, and the impact of HHATs on varietal adoption in coastal Bangladesh. HHATs were conducted in 2021â€“2022 and 2022â€“2023, with data collected from April to June 2023. Using purposive sampling, 50 participant farmers were selected, while 150 neighboring farmers were systematically sampled based on geographic proximity. Findings indicate that yield, taste, and resilience to salinity and drought were the most important traits influencing varietal selection. While farmers valued the superior grain quality and resilience of newer varieties, concerns over yield consistency and climate adaptability led many to continue adopting older varieties. HHATs created spillover effects, encouraging broader adoption among neighboring farmers.

Therefore, it is essential to monitor bush encroachment and widespread debushing activities, including selective bush thinning and complete bush clearing. The aim of study was to develop a system to map and monitor fractional woody cover (FWC) at national scales (50 m and 75 m resolution) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data (Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) global mosaics, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016) and ancillary variables (mean annual precipitationâ€”MAP, elevation), with ML models that were trained with diverse airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data sets (244,032 ha, 2008â€“2014). When only the SAR variables were used, an average R2 of 0.65 (RSME = 0.16) was attained. Adding either elevation or MAP, or both ancillary variables, increased the mean R2 to 0.75 (RSME = 0.13), and 0.79 (RSME = 0.12). The inclusion of MAP addressed the overestimation of FWC in very arid areas, but resulted in anomalies in the form of sharp gradients in FWC along a MAP contour which were most likely caused by to the geographic distribution of the LiDAR training data. Additional targeted LiDAR acquisitions could address this issue. This was the first attempt to produce SAR-derived FWC maps for Namibia and the maps contain substantially more detailed spatial information on woody vegetation structure than existing national maps. During the seven-year study period the Shrublandâ€“WooDLand Mosaic was the only vegetation structural class that exhibited a regional net gain in FWC of more than 0.2 across 9% (11,906 km2) of its area that may potentially be attributed to bush encroachment.

They also enhance freshwater availability and aid in improving land productivity. These polders are equipped with sluice gates for water to drain out and intake into the polders. Each sluice has its own catchment area, defined by the elevation and connectivity with canal systems that carry fresh or saline water from surrounding rivers or streams. The sluice gates operation is influenced by in-polder water management for crop cultivation, diurnal tidal dynamics, and the seasonal variations of saline and fresh water in the peripheral river networks. During the dry season, limited flows in the lower Ganges River allow seawater to push inland, causing saltwater intrusion in the peripheral rivers until the rainy season. Community-coordinated sluice gate operations can improve water management, facilitating timely drainage and irrigation, which is essential for high-yielding rice and subsequent dry-season crops. To address these challenges, a multi-variate LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was employed to forecast salinity levels in rivers near 29 sluice gates in a polder near Khulna City in southwest Bangladesh. Utilizing salinity data from July 2011 to December 2022, the models were trained (2011-18) and validated (2018-20) with covariates of discharge, water level, and an upstream reference station. A hierarchical variable additive approach was used to sequentially estimate salinity from upstream to downstream. The NSE was over 0.90 and PBIAS under 5% for all sluice gate locations, confirming accuracy in reconstructing the time series. For forecast testing, the 2020-22 dataset also showed significant confirmation with NSE values over 0.90 and PBIAS under 10%. With readily available input data, the developed salinity forecast model can effectively capture annual and seasonal salinity fluctuations along all sluice gate locations. These forecasting capabilities can potentially identify critical seasonal windows for sluice gate operations, giving the farmers in the polder a 30-day lead time for freshwater intake for irrigation and starting agricultural operations in the aman season.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hDL.hanDLe.net/10568/168948

Collection and analysis of large volumes of on-farm production data are widely seen as key to understanding yield variability among farmers and improving resource-use efficiency.

Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the performance of statistical and ML methods to explain and predict crop yield across thousands of farmersâ€™ fields in contrasting farming systems worldwide.

Methods
A large database of 10,940 field-year combinations from three countries in different stages of agricultural intensification was analyzed. Random effects models were used to partition crop yield variability and random forest models were used to explain and predict crop yield within a cross-validation scheme with data re-sampling over space and time.

Results
Yield variability in relative terms was smallest for wheat and barley in the Netherlands and for wheat in Ethiopia, intermediate for rice in the Philippines, and greatest for maize in Ethiopia. Random forest models comprising a total of 87 variables explained a maximum of 65 % of cereal yield variability in the Netherlands and less than 45 % of cereal yield variability in Ethiopia and in the Philippines. Crop management related variables were important to explain and predict cereal yields in Ethiopia, while predictive (i.e., known before the growing season) climatic variables and explanatory (i.e., known during or after the growing season) climatic variables were most important to explain and predict cereal yield variability in the Philippines and in the Netherlands, respectively. Finally, model cross-validation for regions or years not seen during model training reduced the R2 considerably for most crop x country combinations, while for wheat in the Netherlands this was model dependent.

Conclusion
Big data from farmersâ€™ fields is useful to explain on-farm yield variability to some extent, but not to predict it across time and space.

Significance
The results call for moderate expectations towards big data and ML in agronomic studies, particularly for smallholder farms in the tropics where model performance was poorest independently of the variables considered and the cross-validation scheme used.",on-farm yield variability,random forest models,big data from farmersâ€™ fields is useful to explain on-farm yield variability,agriculture;ai;yield prediction,"This publication examines the contribution of spatial and temporal data to yield variability in cereal production across three countries with varying intensification stages.

The CNN model showed a significant variation in estimation accuracy across the untrained four locations, indicating insufficient robustness of the base model. Subsequently, we quantitatively tested the impact of improving training data diversity on model robustness by adding data from each of the four locations to the base model's training data.

This review synthesizes current knowledge of climate-induced quality changes in temperate-grown rice, focusing on the Australian industry as a primary case study alongside comparisons with other temperate regions. Environmental factors including temperature extremes, altered rainfall patterns, elevated COâ‚‚, and increased salinity negatively impact key physicochemical, textural and aromatic properties of rice qual-ity classes. Different rice classes display distinct vulnerabilities that impact market value in the trade: medium-grain japonica varieties show reduced amylose content under heat stress, aromatic varieties experience altered aroma compound synthesis under drought, and long-grain types show compromised kernel integrity under com-bined stress with reduced head rice yield and increase of percent chalk. Emerging phenotyping tools, including hyperspectral imaging and ML, offer promising approaches for monitoring impacts and speeding adaptation. The Australi-an rice industry has built adaptive capacity through cold-tolerant breeding, precision agriculture, and water-efficient practices. However, projected scenarios of more ex-treme temperature variability and altered precipitation present continuing challenges to the temperate rice industry.

Accurate mapping of this practice can improve rice production estimates. However, current efforts have mainly relied on optical sensors, which are limited by cloud cover, especially during the wet season when ratooning is common. This study systematically assessed the use of optical Sentinel-2, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data and their combination to map ratoon rice crops. Field data were collected in four provinces of the Philippines in 2018â€“19. Backscatter intensity from Sentinel-1, spectral information, and six commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 were analysed using the Mann-Whitney Usignificance test to examine differences between the main and ratoon rice crops. Next, we compared the classification performance of decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that ratoon and main rice crop significantly differed in VV and VH polarisations, red edge and near-infrared bands, and all VIs. The highest accuracy was achieved with selected features in an RF classifier (overall accuracy of 92 %), compared to SVM (87 %) and DT (81 %). Classification using features from both Sentinel-1 and 2 consistently yielded higher accuracy than using features from one sensor alone.

However, in dry areas of West Africa, negative effects associated with climate change and widespread water scarcity hamper efforts to increase the productivity of irrigated rice. Quantifying rice yields and water productivity and identifying the drivers for the prevailing variability can aid in the targeting and dissemination of appropriate soil, water, and crop management practices. Objective: The main objectives of this research were: (i) to quantify the rice yield gap in representative irrigated systems in dry areas of West Africa, both in wet and dry seasons, and identify factors that can contribute to narrowing the gap, and (ii) to assess the trade-offs or synergies between productivity and resource (water and fertiliser) use efficiency. Methods: We monitored 203 and 192 smallholder farmersâ€™ fields in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, in four contrasting irrigation schemes in Burkina Faso from 2018 to 2020 and assessed key performance indicators (grain yield, water productivity, and nutrient use efficiency). We calculated rice yield gaps (difference between exploitable and actual farmer yields) and identified the drivers of variability of yield and water productivity using ML and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature importance. Results: Indicators of productivity and sustainability differed between irrigation schemes and seasons. Rice yield was higher in wet (5.3 Mg haâˆ’ 1 ) than in dry seasons (3.7 Mg haâˆ’ 1 ), while the variability was higher in the dry (CV = 46%) than in the wet seasons (CV = 29%). Also, the yield gap was slightly higher in the dry (36%) than in the wet seasons (31%). While differences in the number of seeDLings per hill and the source of seeds were the key drivers of yield variability in wet-season rice, the split of N fertilizer applications, bird control, and the soil dryness index were the most important in dry-season rice. Furthermore, within seasons, high-yielding fields had higher water productivity, and N, P, and K use efficiencies. Conclusion: These findings suggest that rice yields can be increased without trade-offs with water productivity and nutrient use efficiencies. Significance: This is the first study highlighting the season-specificity of determinants of variability of yield and water productivity in irrigated rice in West Africa.

However, the prevalence, frequency and severity have not been evaluated using validated tools.
Methods: Australian adults, pwCF and healthy controls (HC) were invited to complete an online questionnaire from July 2023 â€“ February 2024, consisting of four validated tools: Brief Pain Inventory, Pain Catastrophising Scale, PAGI-SYM and PAC-SYM. The questionnaire, disseminated via Cystic Fibrosis Australia, CF Together and online social media groups, explored experiences surrounding pain and its management using closed and free text entries.
Results: There were 206 respondents, consisting of 117 CF patients and 89 HC. Over 70 % (nÂ = 69) of pwCF reported pain compared to 28 % (nÂ = 21) of HC (pÂ = <0.001). Further, significantly higher pain frequency per month was reported for pwCF than HC (40 % vs. 10 %;Â pÂ < 0.001). Symptom clustering was also observed where at least three other locations of pain were reported, and pain was reported to trigger other physiological and psychological symptoms. Notably, there was no significant difference in the locations, occurrence, frequency or severity of pain between those on a CFTR modulator or not (pÂ = 0.625). PwCF also reported significantly lower relief from over-the-counter therapies (pÂ = 0.002) and expressed themes of unmet symptom and management needs.
Conclusions: This study identified a high prevalence of pain affecting multiple body parts in pwCF compared to HC and suggests that pain is sub-optimally managed, impairing their quality of life.

RIICE (Remote sensing-based Information and Insurance for Crops in Emerging Economies) technology, developed since 2010 by sarmap and the International Rice Research Institute, has proven effective in Southeast Asia for monitoring rice production using satellite data. In Nigeria, rice is a key staple crop, yet reliable data on cultivated area and yield are lacking, limiting the ability to design effective interventions for improving productivity.
Objective
This study aims to apply and improve the RIICE approach to provide accurate and up-to-date estimates of rice cultivated area, yield, and yield gaps in Nigeria.
Methods
Over 1500 geolocated ground-truth points were collected across Kano, Jigawa, and Benue States during the 2022 and 2023 wet and dry seasons. RIICE technology was used to analyze the temporal signatures of satellite data to detect rice areas and crop season start dates. These outputs, combined with agronomic inputs such as soil characteristics, fertilizer use, and water availability, were fed into a crop model to estimate yields and assess yield gaps.
Results and conclusion
In the 2023 wet season, estimated rice cultivation areas were 226,702 ha in Kano, 113,871 ha in Jigawa, and 317,282 ha in Benue, with detection accuracy ranging from 85 to 90 % in Kano and Jigawa and 75â€“85 % in Benue. Yield estimates showed Kano achieving averages of 5.1 t/ha (dry) and 5.0 t/ha (wet) under irrigated system, while Jigawa yielded 3.9 t/ha (dry) and 3.8 t/ha (wet). In Benue, yields averaged 3.5 t/ha, with some areas producing <1.0 t/ha. Yield gaps were significant: 3.0â€“3.2 t/ha in Kano and 4.0â€“4.1 t/ha in Jigawa, highlighting the need for targeted agronomic interventions to bridge these gaps and enhance rice productivity.

Increase in rice production has come mainly from increased harvested area. Yield increase has been limited and the current average yield in SSA is around 2 t haâˆ’1. This paper aims to provide the status quo of (i) current rice production and its challenges, (ii) selected achievements in rice agronomy research mainly by the Africa Rice Center and its partners, and (iii) perspectives for future research on rice agronomy in SSA. The major problems confronting rice production include low yield in rainfed environments, accounting for 70% of the total rice harvested area. Rainfed rice yields are strongly affected by climate extremes such as water stresses, soil-related constraints, and sub-optimum natural resource management and crop management practices by smallholder farmers including poor water management, and suboptimal use of fertilizers, herbicides, and machineries. For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies. We conclude that further research efforts are needed to develop locally adapted agronomic solutions for sustainable intensification, especially in rainfed rice to enhance the resilience to climate change and increase land and labor productivity and sustainability of rice cultivation in SSA.","Development of integrated weed, pest, and disease management strategies for different rice-growing environments",appropriate mechanization options that can make an impact on improved efficiency of resources,achieving food security and rice self-sufficiency,soil properties;sustainable intensification;agriculture;climate change;fertilization,"This publication reviews a strategic project initiated in 2022 focusing on mechanization in agriculture to enhance productivity and efficiency of resource use in rice cultivation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Remote sensing, particularly the use of high-resolution multispectral imagery, has emerged as a powerful tool for mapping and assessing agricultural production systems with enhanced precision. In Cambodia, where rice farming dominates the landscape, understanding spatial variations in land use and cropping patterns is essential for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.
 This study aims to classify land use and assess agricultural production systems in selected sites in Takeo and Prey Veng provinces, Cambodia, using high-resolution satellite imagery from Pleiades (0.5 m) and SPOT 7 (1.5 m). By integrating satellite-derived data with field-based validation techniques, this study seeks to improve classification accuracy and enhance our understanding of land use dynamics in these regions.
 The study employs Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier within the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) in QGIS. This approach leverages spectral, textural, and spatial attributes to enhance classification accuracy while minimizing misclassification errors commonly associated with pixel-based methods. The classification results are further validated using ground truth data collected through field surveys and supplementary sources such as Google Earth and the RIICE projectâ€™s rice area maps.
 The findings provide insights into the spatial distribution of key land cover types, including rice fields, fallow croplands, built-up areas, and tree cover. Additionally, the study highlights challenges in differentiating specific land use classes due to spectral similarities and seasonal variations.

However, the stability and bioaccessibility of these bioactive compounds present significant challenges. In this study, 542 brown (including pigmented and non-pigmented) whole grain rice samples were screened for their antioxidant components and capacity, leading to the identification of three superior cultivars: Balatinao variable purple rice, Ketan Hitam variable purple rice, and Kintuman red rice. Using response surface methodology, rice bran extracts from these cultivars were subjected to microencapsulation to stabilize the phytochemicals. Among the microencapsulated rice bran extracts (MRBEs), Ketan Hitam MRBE demonstrated significantly higher total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity. This enhancement is likely due to the increased concentrations of isovitexin, luteolin 7-glucoside, and vitexin following microencapsulation. Furthermore, compared to non-encapsulated rice bran extracts, MRBEs exhibited significantly improved anticancer activity against HCT116 (colon) and A549 (lung) cancer cell lines (P < 0.05). Subsequent fractionation of the MRBE allowed for the identification of the most bioactive fractions, which contained metabolites effective against these cancer cell lines. In addition, in vitrobioaccessibility assays revealed a controlled release of 19 targeted phenolic compounds. This release profile was characterized by an initial increase during the gastric digestion phase, followed by a decrease in the intestinal phase. Notably, phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and vanillin were preserved across the three rice varieties after microencapsulation. These findings underscore the potential of MRBEs as functional food ingredients or supplements, offering improved bioaccessibility of phenolics, enhanced antioxidant properties, and promising anticancer activity. The results support the integration of rice bran extracts into the rice value chain, promoting their use in functional health applications.",addressing diet-related non-communicable diseases,MRBEs as functional food ingredients,transforming rice branâ€”a traditionally underutilized byproductâ€”into high-value nutritional products for both consumers and farmers,rice;antioxidants;cancer;functional food;nutrition,"This study investigates the potential of microencapsulated rice bran extracts (MRBEs) from three superior rice cultivars to improve stability and bioactivity of phenolic compounds, ultimately addressing diet-related non-communicable diseases.

Here we analyse a novel dataset of more than 31,000 farmer fields spanning the Terai of Nepal, Bangladesh's floodplains and four major rice-producing regions of India. Results indicate that 55% of rice farmers overuse nitrogen fertilizer, and hence the region could save 18 kg of nitrogen per hectare without compromising rice yield. Disincentivizing this excess nitrogen application presents the most impactful pathway for increasing NUE. Addressing yield constraints unrelated to crop nutrition can also improve NUE, most promisingly through earlier transplanting and improving water management, and this secondary pathway was overlooked in the IPCC's 2022 report on climate change mitigation.

Value chain interventions have become widespread throughout the international development sector over the last 20 years, and there is a need to evaluate their effectiveness in improving women's welfare across multiple dimensions. Agricultural value chains are influenced by socio-cultural norms and gender dynamics that have an impact on the distribution of resources, benefits, and access to opportunities. While women play a critical role in agriculture, they are generally confined to the least-valued parts of the value chain with the lowest economic returns, depending on the local, social and institutional contexts.

Objectives
The review assesses the effectiveness of approaches, strategies and interventions focused on women's engagement in agricultural value chains that lead to women's economic empowerment in low- and midDLe-income countries. It explores the contextual barriers and facilitators that determine women's participation in value chains and ultimately impact their effectiveness.

Selection Criteria
The review includes value chain interventions evaluating the economic empowerment outcomes. The review includes effectiveness studies (experimental and non-experimental studies with a comparison group) and process evaluations.

Data Collection and Analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, critically appraised the studies, and synthesised findings.

Results
We found that value chain interventions are successful in improving the economic conditions of their intended beneficiaries. The interventions were found to improve women's economic outcomes such as income, assets holdings, productivity, and savings, but these effects were small in size and limited by low confidence in methodological quality. The meta-analysis suggests that this occurs more via the acquisition of skills and improved inputs, rather than through improvement in access to profitable markets. The qualitative evidence on interventions points to the persistence of cultural barriers and other constraints. Those interventions implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are consistently more successful for all outcomes considered, although there are few studies conducted in other areas of the world.

Conclusions
The review concludes that value chain interventions empower women, but perhaps to a lesser extent than expected. Economic empowerment does not immediately translate into empowerment within families and communities. Interventions should either moderate their expectations of empowerment goals, or they should be implemented in a way that ensures higher rates of participation among women and the acquisition of greater decision-making power.;Background

To address this issue, we aim to uncover the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that regulate nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) - as a function of water availability - in Oryza sativa, a staple for 3.5 billion people. In this study, we infer and validate GRNs that correlate with rice NUE phenotypes affected by N-by-W availability in the field. We did this by exploiting RNA-seq and crop phenotype data from 19 rice varieties grown in a 2x2 N-by-W matrix in the field. First, to identify gene-to-NUE field phenotypes, we analyzed these datasets using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). This identified two network modules (skyblue & grey60) highly correlated with NUE grain yield (NUEg). Next, we focused on 90 TFs contained in these two NUEg modules and predicted their genome-wide targets using the N-and/or-W response datasets using a random forest network inference approach (GENIE3). Next, to validate the GENIE3 TFâ†’target gene predictions, we performed Precision/Recall Analysis (AUPR) using nine datasets for three TFs validated in planta. This analysis sets a precision threshold of 0.31, used to prune the GENIE3 network for high-confidence TFâ†’target gene edges, comprising 88 TFs and 5,716 N-and/or-W response genes. Next, we ranked these 88 TFs based on their significant influence on NUEg target genes responsive to N and/or W signaling. This resulted in a list of 18 prioritized TFs that regulate 551 NUEg target genes responsive to N and/or W signals. We validated the direct regulated targets of two of these candidate NUEg TFs in a plant cell-based TF assay called TARGET, for which we also had in planta data for comparison. Gene ontology analysis revealed that 6/18 NUEg TFs - OsbZIP23 (LOC_Os02g52780), Oshox22 (LOC_Os04g45810), LOB39 (LOC_Os03g41330), Oshox13 (LOC_Os03g08960), LOC_Os11g38870, and LOC_Os06g14670 - regulate genes annotated for N and/or W signaling.

Our study investigates the potential of AI model ensembling and hybridization approaches to infer sorghum crop traits from RGB images generated via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In our study, we cultivated 21 sorghum cultivars in two independent seasons (2021 and 2022) with a gradient of fertilizer and water inputs. We collected 470 ground-truth N measurements and captured corresponding RGB images with a drone-mounted camera. We computed five RGB vegetation indices, employed several ML models such as MLR, MLP, and various CNN architectures (season 2021), and compared their prediction accuracy for N-inference on the independent test set (season 2022). We assessed strategies that leveraged both deep and handcrafted features, namely hybridized and ensembled AI architectures. Our approach considered two different datasets collected during the two seasons (2021 and 2022), with the training set from the first season only. This allowed for testing of the modelsâ€™ robustness, particularly their sensitivity to concept drifts, in the independent season (2022), which is fundamental for practical agriculture applications.

The development of pangenomes has revolutionized genomic studies by capturing the complete genetic diversity within a species. Pangenome assembly integrates data from multiple individuals to construct a comprehensive genomic landscape, revealing both core and accessory genomic elements. This approach enables the identification of novel genes, structural variations, and gene presence-absence variations, providing insights into species evolution, adaptation, and trait variation. Representing pangenomes requires innovative visualization formats that effectively convey the complex genomic structures and variations.
Aim
This review delves into contemporary methodologies and recent advancements in constructing pangenomes, particularly in plant genomes. It examines the structure of pangenome representation, including format comparison, conversion, visualization techniques, and their implications for enhancing crop improvement strategies.
Key scientific concepts of review
Earlier comparative studies have illuminated novel gene sequences, copy number variations, and presence-absence variations across diverse crop species. The concept of a pan-genome, which captures multiple genetic variations from a broad spectrum of genotypes, offers a holistic perspective of a speciesâ€™ genetic makeup. However, constructing a pan-genome for plants with larger genomes poses challenges, including managing vast genome sequence data and comprehending the genetic variations within the germplasm. To address these challenges, researchers have explored cost-effective alternatives to encapsulate species diversity in a single assembly known as a pangenome. This involves reducing the volume of genome sequences while focusing on genetic variations. With the growing prominence of the pan-genome concept in plant genomics, several software tools have emerged to facilitate pangenome construction.
This review sheds light on developing and utilizing software tools tailored for constructing pan-genomes in plants. It also discusses representation formats suitable for downstream analyses, offering valuable insights into the genetic landscape and evolutionary dynamics of plant species. In summary, this review underscores the significance of pan-genome construction and representation formats in resolving the genetic architecture of plants, particularly those with complex genomes. It provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements, aiding in exploring and understanding plant genetic diversity.",addressing global food security challenges,developing ML models that can recognize patterns in genomic sequences and structural variations,Fosters agricultural sustainability and improves human nutrition by diversifying crop options for farmers worldwide.,agriculture;genomics;crop improvement;sustainability;nutrition,"This publication highlights the contributions of Prof. Sean Mayes and Dr. Manish K.

Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create trade-offs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind. Overall, strong good governance is needed at multiple levels, combining top-down and bottom-up processes.","critical interactions between climate change, agriculture and food security.",Universal Basic Income (UBI) is posited as a tool for transformation towards a more egalitarian and ecologically sustainable economic order.,"Could considerably enhance the bargaining power of farmers vis-Ã -vis commodity buyers, food processors and retailers.",climate change;agriculture;food security,"The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) aims to examine and address the critical interactions between climate change, agriculture, and food security.

Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into todayâ€™s elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, floweringâ€“maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new speciesâ€™ domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in â€œomicsâ€ sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.",Enhancing the crop genetic diversity in farm landscapes is now more important to sustain the crop yield amid changing climatic conditions and diverse human needs.,Advanced scientific tools can be explored including molecular markers and genomics-assisted selection.,Technologies also help in the rapid enhancement of genetic diversity in crop genepools to keep crops more adaptive to the changing environmental conditions and human need.,domestication;genetic diversity;food legumes;crop improvement;agricultural technology,"This publication discusses the domestication of food legumes and the importance of utilizing advanced scientific tools, such as molecular markers and genomics-assisted selection, to identify superior genotypes.

Additionally, legumes improve the cropping environment by replenishing the soil nitrogen content. Chickpeas are the second most significant staple legume food crop worldwide behind dry bean which contains 17%â€“24% protein, 41%â€“51% carbohydrate, and other important essential minerals, vitamins, dietary fiber, folate, Î²-carotene, anti-oxidants, micronutrients (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc) as well as linoleic and oleic unsaturated fatty acids. Despite these advantages, legumes are far behind cereals in terms of genetic improvement mainly due to far less effort, the bottlenecks of the narrow genetic base, and several biotic and abiotic factors in the scenario of changing climatic conditions. Measures are now called for beyond conventional breeding practices to strategically broadening of narrow genetic base utilizing chickpea wild relatives and improvement of cultivars through advanced breeding approaches with a focus on high yield productivity, biotic and abiotic stresses including climate resilience, and enhanced nutritional values. Desirable donors having such multiple traits have been identified using core and mini core collections from the cultivated gene pool and wild relatives of Chickpea. Several methods have been developed to address cross-species fertilization obstacles and to aid in inter-specific hybridization and introgression of the target gene sequences from wild Cicer species. Additionally, recent advances in â€œOmicsâ€ sciences along with high-throughput and precise phenotyping tools have made it easier to identify genes that regulate traits of interest. Next-generation sequencing technologies, whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and differential genes expression profiling along with a plethora of novel techniques like single nucleotide polymorphism exploiting high-density genotyping by sequencing assays, simple sequence repeat markers, diversity array technology platform, and whole-genome re-sequencing technique led to the identification and development of QTLs and high-density trait mapping of the global chickpea germplasm. These altogether have helped in broadening the narrow genetic base of chickpeas.","Identiï¬cation of novel sources of desired traits, QTLs or alleles through extensive evaluation and utilization of landraces and wild Cicer species will have a greater impact on developing chickpeas for better climate resilience and higher yield.","An integrated application of chickpea â€œOmicsâ€, classical and modern breeding methods, marker-assisted selection, and biotechnological application promises for the broadening of the chickpea genetic base and introgression of new genes for crop traits for higher productivity.",effectively improve the adaptability of current chickpea cultivars in saline soil,chickpea;Omics;genetic gains;climate resilience;biotechnology,"This publication explores the aspects of broadening the chickpea genetic base, with a focus on traits related to seed yield under terminal drought stress.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso Other AI Method, classification and Other AI Method trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered â€œimportantâ€ if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedmanâ€™s H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed Other AI Method-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg haâˆ’1, 276â€“345 kg haâˆ’1, and 0.44â€“0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg haâˆ’1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg haâˆ’1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmersâ€™ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg haâˆ’1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data.",explaining wheat yield variability,machine learning models,"identify pathways for more productive, remunerative, and environmentally sound wheat production",agriculture;machine learning;climate change;nitrogen-use efficiency;crop yield,"This publication discusses the use of machine learning methods to explain wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India.

Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel machine learning (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R2 â‰¥ 0.90, RMSE â‰¤ 0.91, RPD â‰¥ 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48).

The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients â€“ nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) â€“ and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets.

In plant breeding, it has the potential to increase the speed and reduce the cost of selection. However, to optimize resources, sparse testing methods have been proposed. A common approach is to guarantee a proportion of nonoverlapping and overlapping lines allocated randomly in locations, that is, lines appearing in some locations but not in all. In this study we propose using incomplete block designs (IBD), principally, for the allocation of lines to locations in such a way that not all lines are observed in all locations. We compare this allocation with a random allocation of lines to locations guaranteeing that the lines are allocated to the same number of locations as under the IBD design. We implemented this benchmarking on several crop data sets under the Bayesian genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP) model, finding that allocation under the principle of IBD outperformed random allocation by between 1.4% and 26.5% across locations, traits, and data sets in terms of mean square error. Although a wide range of performance improvements were observed, our results provide evidence that using IBD for the allocation of lines to locations can help improve predictive performance compared with random allocation. This has the potential to be applied to large-scale plant breeding programs.",The allocation of lines using IBDs are more time consuming and computationally intensive.,Use of IBDs for sparse testing allocation of lines to locations for genomic prediction.,Improved predictions compared with the standard random allocation of lines to locations.,genomic prediction;plant breeding;IBD;maize;wheat,"This study evaluates the use of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) for optimizing testing allocation in genomic prediction, leading to improved performance in plant breeding.

However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled georeferenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and
wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most
severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3, porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available.","root constraining factors as aeration, sodicity, bedrock, aluminium toxicity, and others",improved maps can be produced,better targeting agronomic R&D interventions in SSA,soil;agriculture;sustainability,This publication discusses the constraints affecting maize rootability and the development of improved soil property maps to enhance agricultural research and development interventions in sub-Saharan Africa.

However, this has been accompanied by increasing input levels and intensive production practices, raising questions about the economic and environmental sustainability of current cropping systems. A multicriteria integrated assessment is required for wheat farms in the region to understand the scope for cleaner wheat production in the future. Production practices from irrigated wheat fields (nâ€¯=â€¯3928) were evaluated for multiple sustainability indicators, namely yield gap, nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, profitability, and greenhouse gas emissions. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with simulated potential yield (Yp) data to identify the causes of wheat yield gaps in the region. N-use efficiency was estimated by calculating the partial factor productivity of N, profitability was computed based on reported input-output amounts and prices, and greenhouse gas emissions were quantified using the Mitigation Options Tool (MOT). These indicators were subjected to a multicriteria assessment using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under different scenarios (i.e., different weights for different indicators). For each scenario, farmersâ€™ fields were classified as most efficient, efficient, less efficient, and least efficient, and random forest was used to identify the most important management practices governing the field classification. Wheat yield gaps were small (25â€“30â€¯% of Yp or 2.4â€¯t haâˆ’1) and mostly attributed to the technology yield gap (ca. 20â€¯% of Yp or 1.5â€¯t haâˆ’1). Ranking and grouping the farmersâ€™ fields in the scenario with equal weights for all indicators revealed that at least 25â€¯% of the fields had very high greenhouse gas emissions (>1500â€¯kg CO2-eq haâˆ’1) at a productivity level of <â€¯4.5â€¯t haâˆ’1, and that it is possible to produce wheat sustainably without compromising yields in Northwest India, as indicated by the performance of the most efficient fields. Tillage intensity and N application rates can be adjusted for least efficient fields (<10â€¯% least efficient fields adopting zero tillage vs >80â€¯% most efficient fields adopting zero tillage) to achieve an overall objective of higher yield, lower greenhouse gas emissions, more profit and higher N-use efficiency, whereas residue retention and tillage intensity would need to be prioritized for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. For the most efficient fields the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions was always associated with a decline in yield level. The most important management practices governing the field classification included the crop establishment method used for the previous rice crop, the number of tillage operations, residue retention, and the N fertilizer rate for wheat. The study provides a data-driven approach to screen trade-offs between performance indicators and to identify the management practices that can deliver sustainable and cleaner crop production in the future.",inability of crop production at the farm and regional levels,methodological approach deployed in this study,provides a blueprint for future integrated assessments of crop production built upon data-driven methods and powered by large databases of farmer field data,agriculture;sustainability;climate-smart practices;rice-wheat system;energy efficiency,"This study aimed to quantify yield gaps and sustainability performance for irrigated wheat farms in Northwest India, revealing that actual farm yields reach about 70% of their potential.

This study examines the yield stability of pearl millet and rice under various management options in West Africa, utilizing both experimental and modeling approaches. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) for pearl millet and rice were calibrated and tested for locally-recommended varieties using LTE data from Niger (pearl millet) and Senegal (rice). Yield stability was evaluated with multiple metrics, including the adjusted coefficient of variation, the sustainable yield index, and the Finlay-Wilkinson Other AI Method coefficient. Both APSIM models exhibited a strong performance for grain yield, with Willmottâ€™s indices of agreement at 0.74 for pearl millet and 0.90 for rice, and absolute root mean square errors of 0.19 and 1.20 Mg ha-1, respectively. The models effectively reproduced yield stability patterns across a variety of management options including planting date, planting density, fertilizer treatments, and residue retention.

Nevertheless, strategies for increasing NUE without jeopardizing food security are uncertain in globally important cropping systems. Here we analyse a novel dataset of more than 31,000 farmer fields spanning the Terai of Nepal, Bangladesh's floodplains and four major rice-producing regions of India. Results indicate that 55% of rice farmers overuse nitrogen fertilizer, and hence the region could save 18 kg of nitrogen per hectare without compromising rice yield. Disincentivizing this excess nitrogen application presents the most impactful pathway for increasing NUE. Addressing yield constraints unrelated to crop nutrition can also improve NUE, most promisingly through earlier transplanting and improving water management, and this secondary pathway was overlooked in the IPCC's 2022 report on climate change mitigation. Combining nitrogen input reduction with changes to agronomic management could increase rice production in South Asia by 8% while reducing environmental pollution from nitrogen fertilizer, measured as nitrogen surplus, by 36%. Even so, opportunities to improve NUE vary within South Asia, which necessitates sub-regional strategies for sustainable nitrogen management.","Controlled experiments provide valuable insights into how agronomic factors influence the NUE of rice crops.

Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model-based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products.

Livestock mortality (0.59 Â± 1.62 TLU farm â€“1 ) was found to be in the same order of magnitude as livestock offtake (0.64 Â± 1.32 TLU farm â€“1 ). Cereal production was supported by livestock, demonstrating the importance of crop-livestock interactions in these mixed farming systems. Three farm types were identified in our analysis. Crop-oriented mixed farms (31%) are likely to be the ones most responsive to crop-specific interventions e.g., crop rotation and integrated pest management. Livestock-oriented mixed farms (34%) are likely to benefit the most from livestock-specific interventions, e.g., home feed. Mixed farms dependent on off-farm activities (36% of the sample) may require nutrition-sensitive and labour-saving sustainable intensification technologies to benefit from their limited resources. Reducing cattle mortality is a priority for all three farm types. The method proposed here could be adapted to other contexts characterized by heterogeneous farming populations to target interventions.",Reducing the climate vulnerability of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.,nutrition-sensitive and labour-saving sustainable intensification technologies,benefit different farm types,agriculture;climate variability;food security;smallholder farmers;mixed crop-livestock,This publication examines the tailoring of interventions for mixed crop-livestock farms in semi-arid Zimbabwe using statistical typology and frontier analysis.

There is limited information on how catena features can be used to refine fertiliser recommendations in the undulating landscapes of the east African highlands.

Aims
(1) Determine the effects of landscape positions and soil types on crop-nutrient responses, and rainwater productivity (RWP);and (2) identify wheat yield-limiting nutrients across landscape positions.

Methods
Two sets of on-farm nutrient management experiments with wheat were conducted on foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions over 71 sites in 2016 and 2019. The first experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, Regosols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5, K2O, and SO4. The second experiment were on Vertisols, Nitisols, and Cambisols with different levels of N/P2O5 and Zn.

Key results
NP increased yield across landscape positions. NP Ã— K and NP Ã— S interactions increased total biomass by 5â€“76%. Zinc Ã— soil type interaction increased total biomass on Vertisols (6%) and Cambisols (9%), but increasing Zn did not improve yield on Nitisols. Zinc Ã— landscape position interaction increased total biomass at foot slope (2%) and mid-slope (13%) positions. Zinc Ã— NP interaction increased biomass yield on Cambisols, Nitisols, and Vertisols. N138P69 significantly increased RWP at foot slope, mid-slope, and hillslope positions. Soil nutrient and water contents decreased with increasing slope regardless of nutrient source and application rate.

Conclusions
Landscape position may be an indicator for targeting site-specific fertiliser recommendations. Farms on hillslopes could be better ameliorated by applying organic amendments with sustainable land management practices.

Implications
Taking into account landscape position can help better manage fertiliser use on undulating land in the east African highlands.;and (2) identify wheat yield-limiting nutrients across landscape positions.

However, assessing the similarity of multivariate time series data presents several challenges, including dealing with large datasets, addressing temporal misalignments, and necessitating efficient and comprehensive analytical frameworks. A novel integrated computational approach, Multivariate Time series Alignment and Similarity Assessment (MTASA) is proposed to address these challenges. MTASA is built upon a hybrid methodology designed to optimise time series alignment, complemented by a multiprocessing engine that enhances the utilisation of computational resources. This integrated approach comprises four key components, each addressing essential aspects of time series similarity assessment, offering a comprehensive framework for analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of MTASA, we conducted an empirical study focused on assessing agroecological similarity, a key aspect of climate smart agriculture, using real-world environmental data. The results from this study highlight MTASAâ€™s superiority, achieving approximately 1.5 times greater accuracy and twice the speed compared with existing state-of-the-art integrated frameworks for multivariate time series similarity assessment. It is hoped that MTASA will significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of multivariate time series analysis, benefitting researchers and practitioners across various domains.

Cassava productivity is limited by poor weed management. Field trials were conducted in Zambia to determine the Critical Period for Weed Removal (CPWR) on 3 cassava varieties (Chila, Mweru and Nalumino), with contrasting canopy structure, using a split-plot design in randomized blocks. Nine weeding treatments, i.e., control, 21, 42, 63, 84, 105, 126, 147, 168 days after planting (DAP), were applied on two sets of weeding regimes. In one set, weeds were allowed to grow followed by a weed free period while in the second, plots were kept weed-free followed by a period of natural weed infestation at Kabangwe and Kaoma. Cassava varietal
means were in the order Chila (10,199 kg ha-1) > Nalumino (9,047.6 kg ha-1) > Mweru (8,429 kg ha-1). Chila, a branching cassava variety, significantly out-yielded (P < 0.05) other varieties.

However, in many food-insecure countries, price data is often delayed, lacks spatial detail, or is unavailable during crises when markets may become inaccessible, and rising prices can rapidly exacerbate hunger. Recent innovations, such as AI-driven data imputation and crowdsourcing, present new opportunities to generate continuous, localized price data. This paper evaluates the reliability of these approaches by comparing them to traditional enumerator-led data collection in northern Nigeria, a region affected by conflict, food insecurity, and data scarcity. The analysis examines crowdsourced prices for two staple food commodities, maize and rice, submitted daily by volunteers through a smartphone application over 36 months (2019â€“2021), and compares them with data collected concurrently by trained enumerators during the final eight months of 2021. Additionally, the crowdsourced dataset is compared to AI-imputed prices from the World Bankâ€™s Real-Time Prices (RTP) database. Data from the alternative methods reflected similar price inflation trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients indicate strong statistical agreement between crowdsourced and enumerator-collected prices (r =â€‰ 0.94 for yellow and white maize, r =â€‰ 0.96 for Indian rice, and r =â€‰ 0.78 for Thailand rice). Furthermore, the crowdsourced data shows a high correlation with the AI-imputed prices (r =â€‰ 0.99 for maize, and r =â€‰ 0.94 for rice). The results from additional statistical tests of normality and paired means shows that the discrepancies between price datasets are consistent with measurement error rather than differences in actual price dynamics. Further tests of equivalence confirmed that enumerator and crowdsourced prices represent the same underlying market processes for specific commodity subtypes, and connotes that crowdsourced price data is a credible reference for validating AI-imputed estimates. The results support the use of AI imputation and crowdsourcing methods to improve price data collection and track market dynamics in near real time.

The development of pangenomes has revolutionized genomic studies by capturing the complete genetic diversity within a species. Pangenome assembly integrates data from multiple individuals to construct a comprehensive genomic landscape, revealing both core and accessory genomic elements. This approach enables the identification of novel genes, structural variations, and gene presence-absence variations, providing insights into species evolution, adaptation, and trait variation. Representing pangenomes requires innovative visualization formats that effectively convey the complex genomic structures and variations.
Aim
This review delves into contemporary methodologies and recent advancements in constructing pangenomes, particularly in plant genomes. It examines the structure of pangenome representation, including format comparison, conversion, visualization techniques, and their implications for enhancing crop improvement strategies.
Key scientific concepts of review
Earlier comparative studies have illuminated novel gene sequences, copy number variations, and presence-absence variations across diverse crop species. The concept of a pan-genome, which captures multiple genetic variations from a broad spectrum of genotypes, offers a holistic perspective of a speciesâ€™ genetic makeup. However, constructing a pan-genome for plants with larger genomes poses challenges, including managing vast genome sequence data and comprehending the genetic variations within the germplasm. To address these challenges, researchers have explored cost-effective alternatives to encapsulate species diversity in a single assembly known as a pangenome. This involves reducing the volume of genome sequences while focusing on genetic variations. With the growing prominence of the pan-genome concept in plant genomics, several software tools have emerged to facilitate pangenome construction.
This review sheds light on developing and utilizing software tools tailored for constructing pan-genomes in plants. It also discusses representation formats suitable for downstream analyses, offering valuable insights into the genetic landscape and evolutionary dynamics of plant species. In summary, this review underscores the significance of pan-genome construction and representation formats in resolving the genetic architecture of plants, particularly those with complex genomes. It provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements, aiding in exploring and understanding plant genetic diversity.",addressing global food security challenges,ML/AI algorithms can be leveraged to enhance the formatting of complex genomic data and improve the construction of haplotype graphs.,Fosters agricultural sustainability and improves human nutrition by diversifying crop options for farmers worldwide.,agriculture;sustainability;genomics;crop improvement;nutrition,"This publication discusses the research contributions of Prof. Sean Mayes and Dr. Manish K.

The recommendations were (1) for countries to increase baseline surveillance,(2) to address nomenclature for â€œdata inferredâ€ new viral sequence to differentiate from characterised viruses, and (3) to increase the focus on fundamental biological research to deal with the deluge of new discoveries. Here, we review the progress made on these recommendations in the intervening decade and discuss the anticipated future challenges posed by the broader adoption of HTS in routine biosecurity applications, especially as we move towards a potential asymptote in the rate of virus discovery. The three initial recommendations are still relevant, however, the decade of discovery and development has led to a change in approaches and ways of thinking. A fourth recommendation is made here, to reduce the biosecurity risks through equal inclusion and access to research and technology, locally and globally. This equality will create increased consonance between community members, researchers, risk analysts, biosecurity authorities, and policy makers at national and international levels and a step change reduction of biosecurity incursions of phytopathogenic viruses.","the need remains for (1) countries to increase baseline surveillance, (2) standardized nomenclature for sequence data of putative novel viruses to differentiate from characterised viruses, and (3) a greater focus on fundamental biological research to support risk assessments in light of the deluge of new discoveries from HTS methods",Levelling the playing field through purposeful complementary teams that bridge access to research and use as a guidance the CARE principles to bridge the technology gaps.,leading to a significant reduction in biosecurity incursions of phytopathogenic viruses,virus;detection;plant pathology;agriculture;bioinformatics,"This series of publications examine the implications and advancements in high throughput sequencing for plant viruses, contributing to biosecurity through the detection of novel viruses and viroid diseases.

The current brief aims at documenting an approach developed under the framework of the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project for CSA and CIS bundling through stakeholder consultations in Ghana. Erratic rainfall, prolonged drought and dry spells, decline in yields, and pest outbreaks were scored top five (5) primary climate challenges by stakeholders. Other challenges of importance included soil fertility, irrigation and water management, and access to inputs and finance. Five priority value chains were selected including maize, rice, cowpea, yam, and vegetables. To achieve inclusiveness, soybean, groundnut, cocoa, poultry and goat were added as strategic value chains with high value addition potential. Climate smart agriculture (CSA)  and climate information services (CIS) bundles around these value chains were prioritized for scaling in ten regions in Ghana: Bono, Bono East, Central, North East, Northern, Oti, Savannah, Upper East, Upper West and Volta. Insights from stakeholder perspectives  indicated preference for the following CSA practice and technology types as key to building climate resilience: high-yielding varieties, early-maturing varieties, drought-tolerant varieties, integrated soil fertility management including the use of organic fertilizers, irrigation and water management, integrated pest and disease management, improved breeds, improved postharvest techniques, and climate information services and advisories. Gender and social inclusiveness (GSI) was explored to map relevant CSA practices and technologies for male, female, youth (male and female), and commercial farmers. Generic customizable bundles of CSA-CIS were explored using basic ecosystem and climate risk metrics. A stepwise CSA-CIS investment bundling was designed considering a full CSA investment principle that consists of triple-win productivity-adaptation-mitigation benefits of CSA. The current brief describes a basic CSA-CIS bundling approach using simple metrics. It provides new insights for developing an appealing tool called â€œCSA Bundlerâ€.

However, most maize growing tropical savannas particularly in West and Central African experience the occurrence of frequent droughts and Striga infestation, resulting in 30â€“100% yield losses. This production zones need maize cultivars that combine tolerance to the two stresses. IITA in collaboration with national partners has thus employed a sequential selection scheme to incorporate both drought tolerance and Striga resistance in topical maize hybrids using reliable screening protocols. The main objective of the present study was therefore to use grain yield and other agronomic traits recorded in regional collaborative hybrid trials conducted for 8 years under manged stressful and non-stressful conditions and across rainfed field environments to estimate genetic gains in grain yields using mixed model analyses. The results showed significant (p < 0.05) annual yield gains of 11.89 kg haâˆ’1 under manged drought stress (MDS) and 86.60 kg haâˆ’1 under Striga infestation (STRIN) with concomitant yield increases of 62.65 kg haâˆ’1 under full irrigation (WW), 102.44 kg haâˆ’1 under Striga non-infested (STRNO) conditions and 53.11 kg haâˆ’1 across rainfed field environments. Grain yield displayed significant but not strong genetic correlation of 0.41 Â± 0.07 between MDS and STRIN, indicating that gene expression was not consistent across the two stress conditions.

However, the high phenotyping costs often limit the capacity to evaluate genotypes in all the target environments. Our main objective was to explore the potential of implementing sparse testing in cassava breeding programs to reduce the cost of phenotyping in METs. The population used in this study consisted of 435 cassava genotypes evaluated in five environments in Nigeria for dry matter (dm) and fresh root yield (fyld). Sparse testing designs were developed based on non-overlapping (NOL), completely overlapping (OL), and intermediates between NOL and OL genotypes. Three prediction models were assessed (one based on phenotypes only, while two had genomic data). All the three models had a higher predictive ability and a lower mean square error (MSE) when a large training set was used. Predictive ability increased and MSE reduced when genotype-by-environment interaction (G Ã— E) was modeled for the same training set sizes and allocations. Predictive ability decreased while MSE increased with the increasing OL genotypes across the environments, suggesting that only a few OL genotypes may be required to set up METs for model training.

Nigeria and Cameroon are multi-ethnic countries with diverse preferences for food characteristics. The present study aimed to inform cassava breeders on consumer-prioritized eba quality traits. Consumer testing was carried out using the triadic comparison of technologies (tricot). Diverse consumers in villages, towns and cities evaluated the overall acceptability of eba made from different cassava genotypes. Data from both countries were combined and linked to laboratory analyses of eba and the gari used to make it.

RESULTS
There is a strong preference for eba with higher cohesiveness and eba from gari with higher brightness and especially in Cameroon, with lower redness and yellowness. Relatively higher eba hardness and springiness values are preferred in the Nigerian locations, whereas lower values are preferred in Cameroon. Trends for solubility and swelling power of the gari differ between the two countries. The study also reveals that the older improved cassava genotype TMS30572 is a benchmark genotype with superior eba characteristics across different regions in Nigeria, whereas the recently released variety Game changer performs very well in Cameroon. In both locations, the recently released genotypes Obansanjo-2 and improved variety TM14F1278P0003 have good stability and overall acceptability for eba characteristics.

CONCLUSION
The wide acceptance of a single genotype across diverse geographical and cultural conditions in Nigeria, as well as three acceptable new improved varieties in both locations, indicates that consumers' preferences are surprisingly homogeneous for eba.

Breeders at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture have therefore been developing drought-tolerant maize varieties to attain high grain yields in rainfed maize production zones. The present review provides a historical overview of the approaches used and progress made in developing drought-tolerant hybrids over the years. Breeders made a shift from a wide area testing approach, to the use of managed screening sites, to precisely control the intensity, and timing of drought stress for developing drought-tolerant maize varieties. These sites coupled with the use of molecular markers allowed choosing suitable donors with drought-adaptive alleles for integration into existing elite maize lines to generate new drought-tolerant inbred lines. These elite maize inbred lines have then been used to develop hybrids with enhanced tolerance to drought. Genetic gains estimates were made using performance data of drought-tolerant maize hybrids evaluated in regional trials for 11 years under managed drought stress, well-watered conditions, and across diverse rainfed environments. The results found significant linear annual yield gains of 32.72 kg haâˆ’1 under managed drought stress, 38.29 kg haâˆ’1 under well-watered conditions, and 66.57 kg haâˆ’1 across multiple rainfed field environments. Promising hybrids that deliver high grain yields were also identified for areas affected by drought and variable rainfed growing conditions.

Regions where both vector types co-exist face heightened likelihood of intensified malaria transmission. Hence, understanding vectorsâ€™ ecological interactions, especially their niche overlaps in geographic or environmental space, is crucial for targeted malaria control and elimination strategies. We employed a dynamic cellular automata (CA) model to map niche overlaps among primary (Anopheles gambiae complex, An. funestus group) and secondary (An. pharoensis, An. coustani) malaria vectors across African, using open-access environmental and vector occurrence datasets sourced from open-access geospatial portals, and spanning 1985 to 2021. Prior to modeling, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) involving descriptive statistics, correlation and cluster analysis to glean insights into the relationships between the variables. Spearman correlation analysis revealed weak significant correlations (|r| < 0.3, p-value <0.001) between environmental variables and vectors occurrence, while environmental
variables exhibited strong intercorrelations. Furthermore, An. gambiae complex prevailed at higher elevations with a minimum relative humidity of 22 %, while secondary vectors prevailed at lower elevations with humidity >38 % and temperatures above 20 â—¦C. Our model, with accuracy exceeding 0.9 following validation, revealed expanding malaria vector niche overlaps across Africa, attributed to vectors expansion beyond their native regions. Such expanding vector niche overlaps predisposes numerous areas at risk of sustained and prolonged malaria transmission, underscoring the need for targeted malaria vector control interventions. Furthermore, dynamic modeling approaches, incorporating continuous data updates, captured ecological interactions accurately.","Increased malaria incidence following irrigation practices in the endorheic Rift Valley Basin of Sidama Region, Ethiopia.",integration of ML and artificial intelligence (AI) into the CA model,This knowledge is vital for implementing swift and targeted vector control interventions when necessary.,malaria;irrigation;Ethiopia;vector control;transmission,"This publication investigates the rise in malaria incidence associated with irrigation practices in the endorheic Rift Valley Basin of Sidama Region, Ethiopia.

Smith) is considered a major threat to maize, sorghum, and millet production in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the rigorous work already conducted to reduce FAW prevalence, the dynamics and invasion mechanisms of FAW in Africa are still poorly understood. This study applied interdisciplinary tools, analytics, and algorithms on a FAW dataset with a spatial lens to provide insights and project the intensity of FAW infestation across Africa. The data collected between January 2018 and December 2020 in selected locations were matched with the monthly average data of the climatic and environmental variables. The multilevel analytics aimed to identify the key factors that influence the dynamics of spatial and temporal pest density and occurrence at a 2 km x 2 km grid resolution. The seasonal variations of the identified factors and dynamics were used to calibrate rule-based analytics employed to simulate the monthly densities and occurrence of the FAW for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Three FAW density level classes were inferred, i.e., low (0â€“10 FAW moth per trap), moderate (11â€“30 FAW moth per trap), and high (>30 FAW moth per trap). Results show that monthly density projections were sensitive to the type of FAW host vegetation and the seasonal variability of climatic factors. Moreover, the diversity in the climate patterns and cropping systems across the African sub-regions are considered the main drivers of FAW abundance and variation. An optimum overall accuracy of 53% was obtained across the three years and at a continental scale, however, a gradual increase in prediction accuracy was observed among the years, with 2020 predictions providing accuracies greater than 70%. Apart from the low amount of data in 2018 and 2019, the average level of accuracy obtained could also be explained by the non-inclusion of data related to certain key factors such as the influence of natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, and pathogens) into the analysis. Further detailed data on the occurrence and efficiency of FAW natural enemies in the region may help to complete the tri-trophic interactions between the host plants, pests, and beneficial organisms. Nevertheless, the tool developed in this study provides a framework for field monitoring of FAW in Africa that may be a basis for a future decision support system (DSS).",reduce crop damage by FAW in farms in the study area.,a framework for establishing a FAW early warning system in Africa,ease the adoption of a proactive control measure,Fall Armyworm;Food Security;Agricultural Technologies;Monitoring;Forecasting,"This publication discusses the challenges of managing Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations in East Africa, emphasizing the importance of community-based monitoring and forecasting strategies to mitigate food security risks.

Besides, managers are dealing with a multitude of issues with different organizations working on similar initiatives and projects, leading to a lack of a sustainable impact on smallholder farmers. To transform the current food systems as a more sustainable and resilient model efficient solutions are needed to deliver and convey results. Challenges such as logistics, labour, infrastructure, and equity, must be addressed alongside adapting to increasingly unstable climate conditions which affect the life cycle of transboundary pathogens and pests. In this context, transforming food systems go far beyond just farmers and plant breeders and it requires substantial contributions from industry, global finances, transportation, energy, education, and country developmental sectors including legislators. As a result, a holistic approach is essential for achieving sustainable and resilient food systems to sustain a global population anticipated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. As of 2021, nearly 193 million individuals were affected by food insecurity, 40 million more than in 2020. Meanwhile, the digital world is rapidly advancing with the digital economy estimated at about 20% of the global gross domestic product, suggesting that digital technologies are increasingly accessible even in areas affected by food insecurity. Leveraging these technologies can facilitate the development of climate-smart cultivars that adapt effectively to climate variation, meet consumer preferences, and address human and livestock nutritional needs. Most economically important traits in crops are controlled by multiple loci often with recessive alleles. Considering particularly Africa, this continent has several agro-climatic zones, hence crops need to be adapted to these. Therefore, targeting specific loci using modern tools offers a precise and efficient approach. This review article aims to address how these new technologies can provide a better support to smallholder farmers.","Accelerate genetic improvement, conservation, and agronomy",Advanced genotyping in Mozambican breeding programs,holds the potential for a more comprehensive and effective strategy in enhancing plant traits for increased production.,breeding;genetic improvement;agronomy;conservation;Mozambique,"This publication discusses the advancements in Mozambican breeding programs aimed at accelerating genetic improvement, conservation, and agronomy through the application of advanced genotyping techniques.

Numerous participatory approaches proposed by CGIAR and other research teams over the last four decades have attempted to capture farmersâ€™ priorities/preferences and crop variety field performance in representative growing environments through experimental trials with higher external validity. Yet none have overcome the challenges of scalability, data validity and reliability, and difficulties in capturing socio-economic and environmental heterogeneity. Building on the strengths of these attempts, we developed a new data-generation approach, called triadic comparison of technology options (tricot). Tricot is a decentralized experimental approach supported by crowdsourced citizen science. In this article, we review the development, validation, and evolution of the tricot approach, through our own research results and reviewing the literature in which tricot approaches have been successfully applied. The first results indicated that tricot-aggregated farmer-led assessments contained information with adequate validity and that reliability could be achieved with a large sample. Costs were lower than current participatory approaches. Scaling the tricot approach into a large on-farm testing network successfully registered specific climatic effects of crop variety performance in representative growing environments. Tricotâ€™s recent application in plant breeding networks in relation to decision-making has (i) advanced plant breeding lines recognizing socio-economic heterogeneity, and (ii) identified consumersâ€™ preferences and market demands, generating alternative breeding design priorities.

However, cassava production in East Africa is limited by RNA viruses that cause cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). CBSD typically causes subtle or no symptoms on stems and leaves, while destroying the root tissue, which means farmers are often unaware their fields are infected until they have a failed harvest. The subtle symptoms of CBSD have made it difficult to study the spread of the disease in fields. We will use an engineering advancement, our active multispectral imager (MSI), to rapidly determine the infection status of plants in the field in Tanzania. The MSI observes leaves using many different wavelengths, and the resulting light spectra are interpreted by machine learning models trained on cassava leaf scans. Under laboratory conditions, the MSI detects CBSD infection with 95% accuracy at 28 days post-infection, when plants have no visible symptoms. Our multinational team is studying and modeling the spread of CBSD to assess the efficacy of using the MSI to detect and remove infected cassava plants from fields before CBSD can spread. In addition to improving the food security of people who eat cassava in sub-Saharan Africa, our technology and modeling framework may be useful in diseases of other vegetatively propagated crops such as banana/plantain, potato, sweet potato, and yam.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/159585

Mapping the crop yield from different CA systems across space and time can reveal their spatial recommendation domains. Integration of machine learning (ML) and free remotely sensed big data have opened huge opportunities for data-driven insights into complex problems in agriculture. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial-temporal variations of maize grain yields from 13-year multi-location on-farm trials implemented across four countries in southern Africa. The agronomic data from the long-term CA trials is used together with gridded biophysical and socio-economic variables. A spatially explicit random forest (RF) algorithm was developed. Spatial variation of yield advantage or loss from CA practices was compared with conventional tillage practices (CP) during seasons with above and below-normal precipitation. The out-of-bag accuracy of the RF model was R 2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 1.2 t ha -1 . The variable importance analysis showed that the altitude, precipitation, temperature, and soil physical and nutrients conditions variables explained most of the variation in maize grain yield. Maps were generated to identify the locations where CA had a yield advantage over CP during seasons with below and above-average precipitation. The CA showed yield gains of up-to 1 t ha -1 during the season with drought compared to CP. In contrast, the CA returned yield losses of similar magnitude during the season with above-normal precipitation, except in Mozambique. The maps on yield advantage will support the spatial targeting of CA to suitable biophysical and socioeconomic contexts.

Timely and accurate data on the extent of croplands and the types of cultivated crops are essential to addressing the food insecurity challenges that many African countries face. This information improves crop productivity and helps mitigate production constraints such as pests, climate variability, and other biophysical factors. The precise and timely identification of crop types is necessary for effective food security monitoring and planning. This study used Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and GoPro camera-derived crop labels, along with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and PlanetScope data, to classify crops in Northern Ghana during the 2023 growing season. The classification used random forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithms. The study area covered approximately 290,000 hectares in the Northern and Upper East region of Ghana. An analysis of croplands in the Northern region revealed four primary crops: maize, soybeans, groundnut, and rice. In contrast, the Upper East region primarily cultivates millet, sorghum, maize, groundnut, and rice. The croplands in both regions are complex, mixed, heterogeneous, and patchy. Due to population pressures and the land tenure system, farming systems in the Upper East tend to be smaller and nearer to homesteads. Both algorithms demonstrated satisfactory performance in identifying the predominant crops in each region. The RF and CNN algorithms achieved an overall classification accuracy ranging from 88% to 95% and a crop-specific prediction accuracy ranging from 55% to 80% for soybean, maize, groundnut, and rice in both regions.

The use of mobile near infrared spectroscopy (SCiOâ„¢) is an alternative high throughput phenotyping technology for predicting pasting properties of high quality cassava flour traits. However, model development and validation are necessary to verify that reasonable expectations are established for the accuracy of a prediction model. In the context of an ongoing breeding effort, we investigated the use of an inexpensive, portable spectrometer that only records a portion (740â€“1070 nm) of the whole NIR spectrum to predict cassava pasting properties. Three machine-learning models, namely glmnet, lm, and gbm, implemented in the Caret package in R statistical program, were solely evaluated. Based on calibration statistics (R2, RMSE and MAE), we found that model calibrations using glmnet provided the best model for breakdown viscosity, peak viscosity and pasting temperature. The glmnet model using the first derivative, peak viscosity had calibration and validation accuracy of R2 = 0.56 and R2 = 0.51 respectively while breakdown had calibration and validation accuracy of R2 = 0.66 and R2 = 0.66 respectively. We also found out that stacking of pre-treatments with Moving Average, Savitzky Golay, First Derivative, Second derivative and Standard Normal variate using glmnet model resulted in calibration and validation accuracy of R2 = 0.65 and R2 = 0.64 respectively for pasting temperature.

Objective: This study aimed to introduce a data-driven and dynamic spatial framework that integrates crop area mapping with the delineation of agro-ecological spatial units (ASUs) to characterize Ethiopia's rainfed wheat crop production environments. Methods: annual rainfed wheat areas for the 2021 and 2022 Meher growing seasons were mapped using an ensemble machine-learning approach, leveraging time-series satellite images and environmental data. Dynamic ASUs were delineated using pixel- and object-based clustering methods, considering short-term changes (annual ASUs for 2021 and 2022) and longer-term trends (ASUs developed using data aggregated over the period 2016-2022). Clustering was based on key biophysical variables, including climatic, soil, topographic, and vegetation indices derived from satellite images that capture crop growth and development over space and time. Results and conclusions: The framework captured the spatial and temporal variability of wheat production environments, demonstrating its scalability across space and time.

International Institute of Tropical Agriculture,Effects of urbanization on avian diversity and human-nature interactions in tropical environments,2025,"Awoyemi, A.G.","Awoyemi, A.G.",No Data,Adewale Gboyega Awoyemi,No Data,No Data,Thesis,ML;LLM;NLP;Other AI Methods,SDG 02: Zero Hunger;SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,No Data,"Urbanization is a rapidly expanding global phenomenon that poses significant threats to biodiversity. Despite its importance, the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity in certain regions remain understudied. Recent studies have highlighted the need for more research on the topic, particularly in Africa, where unprecedented urbanization overlaps with vast biodiversity. Thus, this thesis investigated the impacts of urbanization on socioecological systems in the Afrotropics, providing data useful in achieving sustainable urban development in line with SDG Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the region.
This thesis began with a comprehensive systematic literature review to assess the current state of urban ecology in Africa (Chapter 1). The review revealed a striking knowledge gap, with only 795 relevant papers published in the last century (1920â€”2020), much less than those from other continents. Notably, a disproportionate number of these studies (40%) were conducted in South Africa, indicating a significant geographical bias in our current knowledge on the topic. This review found that research efforts are driven by economic wealth (GDP) and the importance of conservation in African urban ecology. However, the review also exposed a surprising oversight: the Afrotropics, which is the most urbanized and biodiverse-rich African region, is not a primary focus of study. Furthermore, most urban ecology studies in Africa were conducted in a single city (55%), with substantial knowledge gaps persisting across taxonomic groups, scientific fields, and ecoregions. To partially address these important gaps, this thesis focused on investigating different research questions in multiple cities in Nigeria (Chapters 2â€”5), a typical Afrotropical country experiencing rapid urbanization. These additional chapters investigated the impacts of urbanization on bird taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity (Chapters 2â€”3), avian-mediated regulating ecosystem services, including pest control, seed dispersal, pollination, and scavenging (Chapter 4), and human-nature interactions (Chapter 5).
The results of these studies unequivocally demonstrated that urbanization has profound negative impacts on bird diversity and ecosystem services in the Afrotropics. Compared to non-urban areas, urban areas exhibited significantly lower bird taxonomic diversity (Chapter 2) and reduced provisioning of essential ecosystem services provided by wildlife, including pest control, seed dispersal and pollination (Chapter 4). Scavenging was the only bird-mediated ecosystem service enhanced by urban development (wet season). Furthermore, certain urban attributes, such as the presence of vehicles and pedestrians, were found to compromise bird phylogenetic divergence and ecosystem service provision, particularly pollination and seed dispersal. However, the results also highlight the potential for targeted conservation efforts to mitigate these negative impacts. Notably, the presence of water bodies and specific vegetation types, such as canopy and bush cover, can significantly enhance multiple components of bird diversity and crucial bird-mediated regulating ecosystem services (Chapters 2 and 4). By preserving and restoring these key habitat features, it may be possible to reverse the decline of bird diversity and the associated regulating ecosystem services in Afrotropical cities, particularly seed dispersal and pollination.
Chapter 3 presents a novel application of machine learning and remote sensing techniques in estimating local habitat variables influencing bird diversity components across urban and non-urban areas. This study revealed that the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI) is the most effective indicator of taxonomic and phylogenetic bird diversity in the Afrotropics. In contrast, the Normalized Difference Water Index 2 (NDWI2) and Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) were found to be the best predictors of functional diversity and phylogenetic divergence, respectively. Interestingly, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a commonly used predictor across regions and topics, ranked relatively low (25th percentile) in most cases. These results recommended the use of these alternative predictors (MCARI, NDWI2 and SATVI) rather than the NDVI in predicting bird biodiversity in urban and non-urban areas of the Afrotropics. This is likely due to NDVI's limitations, including scaling issues, saturation in high-biomass areas, and sensitivity to soil brightness, which can compromise its accuracy in diverse Afrotropical environments. The remote sensing approach employed in this study offers a potentially more efficient and cost-effective method for estimating local habitat variables compared to traditional manual estimation techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and remotely sensed data, this approach can help reduce the labor, expense, and investigator error associated with manual data collection.
In addition to the ecological impacts, urbanization also has significant social implications. By investigating the extinction of experience concept among urban dwellers in Nigeria, Chapter 5 found that most citizens had little or no contact with nature. The main reasons cited for this disconnection were lack of time, money, and nearby natural areas. The study also found that respondents with higher nature contact were more connected to nature, and that the perception of neighborhood safety was an important factor promoting nature contact. Furthermore, the study also found that respondents living in Lagos, and those with lower levels of income and education, showed greater dissociation from nature. These findings could be useful to fight against the worrying extinction of experience in the region, providing potential factors to consider and implement in future urban development plans in the Afrotropics.
Overall, the Chapters of this thesis highlight the need for more research on the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Afrotropics. They also emphasize the importance of promoting nature contact and experience among urban dwellers, particularly in regions with rapid urbanization such as the study area (i.e. Nigeria). By addressing these knowledge gaps and promoting nature experience, we can work towards creating more sustainable and resilient urban ecosystems that will benefit both people and the environment.",Ecosystem services in Africa have been poorly studied,Uso de la teledetecciÃ³n y algoritmos de aprendizaje automÃ¡tico para estimar variables del hÃ¡bitat local.,advance our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on African biodiversity,urban biodiversity;ecosystem services;conservation;Africa;environmental injustice,"The text discusses the appreciation of socio-ecological services and economic benefits provided by urban biodiversity in African urban areas, highlighting the need for public support in conservation efforts.

CONTEXTAddressing the limitations of scaling agronomic recommendations, which are usually confined to small areas, requires a spatial framework for characterizing production environments in a timely and cost-effective manner.2.OBJECTIVEThis study aimed to introduce a data-driven framework to characterize rainfed wheat crop production environments in Ethiopia. The framework entails mapping of the annual rainfed wheat area and the delineation of crop-specific and dynamic agro-ecological spatial units (ASUs).3. METHODSAn ensemble machine learning approach built upon time-series satellite images and environmental data was used for crop type mapping while pixel- and object-based clustering algorithms were used to delineate dynamic ASUs from two temporal perspectives: annual ASUs for the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons to assess short-term dynamism, and ASUs from aggregated data (2016 â€“ 2022) to capture long-term variations in the production environment.4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSModel evaluation showed that the ensemble of random forest, gradient boosting, and classification and Other AI Method trees predicted wheat cropland in the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons with 88-90% accuracy. A concordance in defining ASUs between pixel- and object-based approaches was observed with consistency and dynamism in ASUs from 2021 to 2022 and between single-year and aggregated ASUs across approaches. This consistency and dynamism in ASUs highlight the spatial scalability and temporal flexibility of the framework, which allows for characterizing production environments across scales and analyzing trends and fluctuations, providing valuable insights for addressing food security and environmental challenges.5.SIGNIFICANCEThe developed spatial framework could facilitate future yield gap analysis and agronomic assessments for rainfed wheat in Ethiopia and be transfered to other crops and production environments.","Ethiopiaâ€™s wheat production pathways to self-sufficiency through land area expansion, irrigation advance, and yield gap closure.",spatio-temporal flexibility to capture change in crop production environment,supporting sustainable crop intensification in complex production environments,wheat;self-sufficiency;production pathways;land area expansion;irrigation,"This publication examines Ethiopia's strategies to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production by enhancing land use, improving irrigation systems, and addressing yield gaps.

However, certain biogeographic realms, like the Afrotropics, are clearly understudied despite urbanization overlapping with their biodiversity hotspots. A commonly highlighted reason for the lack of information from the Afrotropics has been the logistical problem associated with data collection in the field. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing imagery offer an excellent opportunity to revert this situation, enhancing the understanding of urban impacts on biodiversity. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used remotely sensed spectral index (hereafter: indicator) despite several studies showing its limitations and advocating for the use of alternative indicators. Thus, this study identifies the best indicators of bird taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in Afrotropical urban and non-urban areas. To do so, we sampled birds at 400 points equally distributed across eight Nigerian areas, two vegetation zones (rainforest vs savannah), and two habitats (urban vs non-urban), and extracted 29 indicators (mean and SD) at 50-m radius of each point (exact area of bird censuses). Random Forest Other AI Methods and Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models were used to identify the topmost ranked indicator of each avian diversity component, and its variation between urban and non-urban areas. The Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI) was the best indicator of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, while the Normalized Difference Water Index II (NDWI2) and Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) got the most support for functional diversity and phylogenetic divergence, respectively. In most cases, NDVI ranks very low (occupying the 25th percentile), not supporting its use for monitoring avian diversity in the Afrotropics. MCARI and NDWI2 showed different associations with taxonomic and functional diversity depending on the habitat, highlighting the need for considering urban areas differently while using these indicators.

We conducted 39 field experiments on the Tibetan Plateau, comparing short-term (â‰¤5â€‰years), 5â€“10â€‰years and long-term (â‰¥10â€‰years) continuous cropping with rotation of Tibetan barley with wheat or rape. Results showed that Tibetan barleyâ€“wheat and Tibetan barleyâ€“rape rotations increased yields by 17% and 12%, respectively, while improving the soil quality index by 11% and 21%, compared with long-term continuous cropping. Both Tibetan barley rotations with wheat and rape improved soil quality and consequently yield, mainly by increasing soil microbial biomass nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon and decreasing pH. By contrast, long-term continuous cropping led to decreased soil organic matter, lower microbial biomass nitrogen and increased pH, contributing to yield decline. The benefits of rotations on crop yield and soil quality increased over time. Implementing crop rotation with wheat or rape thus offers a sustainable agricultural strategy for improving food security on the Tibetan Plateau.",Effects of type and duration of Tibetan barley rotation on soil quality and yield,Rotations to improve crop productivity and soil quality,Mitigates the downward trend in yield and soil quality.,Tibetan barley;soil quality;crop yield;rotations;productivity,"The study explores the impacts of various rotation patterns involving Tibetan barley, wheat, and rape on soil quality and crop yield in the Tibetan Plateau.

This study aimed to assess the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in classifying cassava genotypes based on their cooking times. Five cooking times (15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 minutes) were assessed and 888 genotypes evaluated over three crop seasons (2019/2020, 2020/2021, and 2021/2022). Fifteen roots from five plants per plot, featuring diameters ranging from 4 to 7 cm, were randomly chosen for cooking analysis and spectral data collection. Two root samples (15 slices each) per genotype were collected, with the first set aside for spectral data collection, processed, and placed in two petri dishes, while the second set was utilized for cooking assessment. Cooking data were classified into binary and multiclass variables (CT4C and CT6C). Two NIRs devices, the portable Quality SpecÂ® Trek (QST) and the benchtop NIR Flex N-500 were used to collect spectral data. Classification of genotypes was carried out using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) and partial least squares (PLS) models. The spectral data were split into a training set (80%) and an external validation set (20%). For binary variables, the classification accuracy for cassava cooking time was notably high (R2Cal ranging from 0.72 to 0.99). Regarding multiclass variables, accuracy remained consistent across classes, models, and NIR instruments (~0.63). However, the KNN model demonstrated slightly superior accuracy in classifying all cooking time classes, except for the CT4C variable (QST) in the Noncook and 25 min classes. Despite the increased complexity associated with binary classification, it remained more efficient, offering higher classification accuracy for samples and facilitating the selection of the most relevant time or variables, such as cooking time â‰¤ 30 minutes. The accuracy of the optimal scenario for classifying samples with a cooking time of 30 minutes reached R2Cal = 0.86 and R2Val = 0.84, with a Kappa value of 0.53. Overall, the models exhibited a robust fit for all cooking times, showcasing the significant potential of NIRs as a high-throughput phenotyping tool for classifying cassava genotypes based on cooking time.",Assessment of a larger pool of genotypes concerning attributes associated with root quality,NIRS-based classification model for cooking capacity within 30 minutes,"NIRS phenotyping could be a cost-effective, less labor-intensive, and high-throughput option",cassava;NIRS;machine learning,"This study demonstrates the potential of using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in conjunction with machine learning techniques to phenotype and classify cassava genotypes based on cooking time.

Attempts to measure response variability and quantify the prevalence of non-response empirically are complicated by the fact that data from on-farm fertilizer trials generally include diverse nutrients and do not include on-site replications. The first aspect limits the extent to which different studies can be combined and compared, while the second does not allow to distinguish actual field-level response variability from experimental error and other residual variations. In this study, we assembled datasets from 41 on-farm fertilizer response trials on cereals and legumes across 11 countries, representing different nutrient applications, to assess response variability and quantify the frequency of occurrence of non-response to fertilizers. Using two approaches to account for residual variation, we estimated non-response, defined here as a zero agronomic response to fertilizer in a given year, to be relatively rare, affecting 0â€“1 and 7â€“16% of fields on average for cereals and legumes respectively. The magnitude of response could not be explained by climatic and selected topsoil variables, suggesting that much of the observed variation may relate to unpredictable seasonal and/or local conditions. This implies that, despite demonstrable spatial bias in our sample of trials, the estimated proportion of non-response may be representative for other agro-ecologies across SSA. Under the latter assumption, we estimated that roughly 260,000 ha of cereals and 3,240,000 ha of legumes could be expected to be non-responsive in any particular year.",Heterogeneity of crop productivity and resource use efficiency within smallholder Kenyan farms: soil fertility gradients or management intensity gradients?,We applied two simple approaches to address one or both limitations.,No Data,agriculture;soil fertility;smallholder farms;sub-Saharan Africa,"This collection of studies examines the response of maize to fertilizer use and nitrogen efficiency in various contexts within sub-Saharan Africa.

This study aims to develop a mechanistic model to predict soil organic matter (SOM) stocks in Natura2000 areas of the Cantabria region (Spain). The mechanistic model is established in four steps: (a) identify major processes that influence SOM stocks, (b) review existing models describing the major processes and the respective environmental data that they require, (c) establish a database with the required input data, and (d) calibrate the model with field observations. The SOM stocks map resulting from the mechanistic model had a mean error (ME) of âˆ’2 t SOM haâˆ’1 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 66â€‰t SOM haâˆ’1.

However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled georeferenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and
wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most
severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3, porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available.","root constraining factors as aeration, sodicity, bedrock, aluminium toxicity",produced the first map of rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of the soil of SSA,better targeting agronomic R&D interventions in SSA,soil;agriculture;digital mapping;water management;productivity,"This publication discusses the challenges in mapping rootable soil areas for maize affected by various constraining factors.

A study was performed to generate insights in nutrient limitations for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.). We conducted 627 nutrient omission trials over three years in South East (SEN) and South West Nigeria (SWN), and in the Southern (TSZ) and Lake Zone of Tanzania (TLZ) to quantify variation in root yield responses to N, P and K, and relate these to digital soil maps and weather information. Mean fresh root yields were 30, 21, 13 and 15 Mg ha-1 with an application of 150â€“40-180 kg N-P-K ha-1 and 20, 16, 11 and 14 Mg ha-1 without nutrient addition in the four study areas, respectively. Root yield response to nutrients was largest in SEN, with mean root yield reductions of 5.7, 3.3 and 2.7 Mg ha-1 due to omission of N, P and K, respectively. Differences in yield and yield response to fertiliser between study areas were governed by rainfall conditions, which were most favourable in SEN, and least favourable in the TLZ. Within study areas, large spatial variation was observed, while temporal variation was limited. Spatial variation in yield response was largest in SEN with standard de-viations (sd) of 4.2 Mg ha-1 for K, 3.2 Mg ha-1 for P and 3.0 Mg ha-1 for N, opposite to the order of the mean yield responses. More than 75% of the variation in root yield response was observed at < 10 km scale, and close to 50% at < 1 km scale. Large variation (sd = 1.8 â€“ 2.5 Mg ha-1) in response to N was also observed in all other study areas, and to K in SWN (sd = 2.4 Mg ha-1) and in the TSZ (sd = 2.1 Mg ha-1). Responses to N and P were weakly but significantly correlated to organic C, total N and clay contents, while response to K was correlated to extractable cations and clay content. Random forest models explained 16 â€“ 59% of the variation in nutrient responses within study areas using digital soil maps and weather information. Our results confirm that responses to fertiliser nutrients vary in smallholder systems at a very local scale, and patterns vary between study areas and between individual nutrients. Digital soil maps and weather information can explain some of this variation and could support the development of site-specific recommendations at an appropriate scale. However, digital soil map data are unlikely sufficient to provide reliable advice at farm or plot level.

Whereas legumes can meet a large part of their nitrogen (N) requirement through symbiosis with N2-fixing bacteria, elements such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and secondary and micronutrients may still be limiting and require supplementation. Responses to P are generally strong but variable, while evidence for other nutrients tends to show weak or highly localised effects. Here we present the results of a joint statistical analysis of a series of on-farm nutrient addition trials, implemented across four legumes in four countries over two years. Linear mixed models were used to quantify both mean nutrient responses and their variability, followed by a random forest analysis to determine the extent to which such variability can be explained or predicted by geographic, environmental or farm survey data. Legume response to P was indeed variable, but consistently positive and we predicted application to be profitable for 67% of farms in any given year, based on prevailing input costs and grain prices. Other nutrients did not show significant mean effects, but considerable response variation was found. This response heterogeneity was mostly associated with local or temporary factors and could not be explained or predicted by spatial, biophysical or management factors. An exception was K response, which displayed appreciable spatial variation that could be partly accounted for by spatial and environmental covariables. While of apparent relevance for targeted recommendations, the minor amplitude of expected response, the large proportion of unexplained variation and the unreliability of the predicted spatial patterns suggests that such data-driven targeting is unlikely to be effective with current data.",No Data,No Data,No Data,agriculture;legumes;nutrient application;smallholders;conservation agriculture,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/130658

Several allometric models have been developed to overcome this challenge. Building on past work, the current study developed allometric models for enset fiber, kocho, and bula yield estimation. Enset yield limiting factors and associated yield gaps were also determined. In this study, above-ground growth and yield (kocho, bula, and fiber) traits of five-year-old plants of two widely grown enset landraces, â€˜Unjameâ€™ and â€˜Siskelaâ€™, were assessed in farmersâ€™ fields at three contrasting altitude sites. Except for bula, a minor yield component, correlation, and PCA analysis showed strong association between the above-ground and yield traits. Allometric equations based on the above-ground traits significantly (R2 = 25 to 68%) explained the variation in the yield traits. This study, for the first time, generated allometric models that can reliably estimate enset fiber yield. Leaf length, petiole length, and plant height are especially good for estimating fiber and kocho yields. The performance of models for bula were poor possibly due to the very low bula yields per plant. Soil chemical characteristics differently influenced enset yield attributes. For example, improving K supply can potentially enhance fiber yield. Higher yield gaps were observed for bula, with P accounting for the highest yield gaps across yield traits. Through careful targeting, the different yield attributes can thus be enhanced. This and previous studies clearly show that non-destructive enset plant assessments can provide solid information for quick and easy yield assessments for various traits during e.g., agronomic, germplasm evaluation, soil fertility enhancement, and intercropping trials.","Higher yield gaps were observed for bula, with P accounting for the highest yield gaps.",careful targeting of different soil nutrients,Generated allometric models that can reliably estimate enset fiber yield.,agriculture;enset;food security;biomass;yield,"This study focuses on enset yield attributes and their association with soil nutrients, particularly potassium and phosphorus, indicating that enhancing these nutrient levels can improve fiber and yield variables in enset cultivation.",https://hdl.handle.net/10568/116468

HSI has demonstrated significant potential for obtaining quick information regarding the chemical composition of the root and tuber, such as starch, protein, dry matter, amylose, and soluble sugars, as well as physical characteristics such as textural properties and water binding capacity. This review highlights the principles of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) techniques combined with relevant image processing tools. It then provides cases of its application in determining crucial biochemical quality traits and textural attributes of roots and tuber crops, focusing on cassava and yam. The need for more information on using NIR-HSI in the quality evaluation of yam and cassava was underscored. It also presents the challenges and prospects of this technology.",high dimensionality and the quality of the reference values,NIR-HSI techniques to define and characterize the critical quality parameters for yam and cassava,contribute significantly to breeding programs to incorporate the priority quality characteristics influencing consumersâ€™ decisions,hyperspectral imaging;yam;cassava;quality parameters;breeding,"This publication discusses the limitations of NIR-HSI spectroscopy in analyzing yam and cassava quality parameters.

Berkhout,ezra.berkhout@pbl.nl,No Data,Journal Article,ML;LLM;NLP;Other AI Methods,SDG 02: Zero Hunger,No Data,"Malnutrition, the suboptimal consumption of essential nutrients like zinc, severely affects human health. This burden of malnutrition falls disproportionally heavy on developing countries, directly increasing child mortality and childhood stunting, or reducing peopleâ€™s ability mending diseases. One option to combat malnutrition is to blend missing nutrients in crop fertilizers, thereby increasing crop yields and possibly the nutrient density in harvested crop products, thus enriching crop products destined for human consumption. But, the effectiveness of so-called agronomic fortification remains ill-understood, primarily due to a paucity of field trials. We hypothesize that, if at all this is an effective strategy, there should exist a causal link between malnutrition and natural variation in the quality of soils to begin with. Until now, data limitations prevented the establishment of such a link, but new soil micronutrient maps for Sub-Saharan Africa allow for a detailed assessment. In doing so, we find statistically significant relations between soil nutrients and child mortality, stunting, wasting and underweight. For instance, a simultaneous increase in soil densities of copper, manganese and zinc by one standard deviation reduces child mortality by 4â€“6 per mille points, but only when malaria pressure is modest. The effects of soil nutrients on health dissipate when malaria pressure increases. Yet, the effects are fairly small in magnitude suggesting that except for a few regions, agronomic fortification is a relatively cost ineffective means to combat malnutrition.",Identifying Zambiaâ€™s Industrial Fortification Options: Toward Overcoming the Food and Nutrition Information Gap-Induced Impasse.,Using agronomic fortification to revert malnutrition.,Better understand the potential for using agronomic fortification to revert malnutrition.,agriculture;nutrition;zinc;iron;biofortification,"The publication discusses the importance of addressing micronutrient deficiencies, particularly zinc and iron, in food systems.

We also evaluated the impact of increasing the training population (TP) size by phenotyping progenies selected either at random or with a genetic algorithm.

The phenological development of the maize crop from emergence through flowering to maturity, usually expressed as a rate (i.e. 1/duration), is largely controlled by temperature in the tropics. Maize plant phenological responses vary between varieties and quantifying these responses can help in predicting the timing and duration of critical periods for crop growth that affect the quality and quantity of seed. We used routine multi-environment trials data of diverse tropical maize varieties to: (1) fit 82 temperature dependent phenology models and select the best model for an individual variety, (2) develop a spatial framework that uses the phenology model to predict at landscape level the length of the vegetative and reproductive phases of diverse varieties of maize in different agro-ecologies. Multi-environment trial data of 22 maize varieties from 16 trials in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan was analyzed and the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm combined with statistical criteria was applied to determine the best temperature-dependent model.

The southern armyworm (SAW) Spodoptera eridania (Stoll) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is native to the tropical Americas where the pest can feed on more than 100 plant species. SAW was recently detected in West and Central Africa, feeding on various crops including cassava, cotton, amaranth and tomato. The current work was carried out to predict the potential spatial distribution of SAW and four of its co-evolved parasitoids at a global scale using the maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm.

RESULTS
SAW may not be a huge problem outside its native range (the Americas) for the time being, but may compromise crop yields in specific hotspots in coming years. The analysis of its potential distribution anticipates that the pest might easily migrate east and south from Cameroon and Gabon.

CONCLUSION
The models used generally demonstrate that all the parasitoids considered are good candidates for the biological control of SAW globally, except they will not be able to establish in specific climates.

In recent years, real-time satellite precipitation products (SPPs) development and accessibility have advanced significantly. SPPs may compliment or substitute gauge data, enabling better real-time forecasting of streamflows among other things. SPPs, on the other hand, contain considerable biases that must be addressed before the rainfall predictions can be applied to any hydrologic purpose, including seasonal or real-time forecasts.

The researchers also looked at how the bias adjustment of daily satellite-based rainfall estimates influences the identification of seasonality and extreme rainfall indices in Ghana. The results revealed that the seasonal and annual rainfall patterns in the region were better represented after the bias correction of the CHIRPS-v2 data. We observed that, before bias correction, the cessation dates in the countryâ€™s southwest and upper middle regions were slightly different. However, they matched those of the gauge well after bias correction.

We analysed 13 protein-rich crops, using the crop suitability model EcoCrop and climate projections for the 2050s, based on 30 Global Circulation Models, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5. The results suggest that current protein-rich crop distributions reflect climatic suitability. We demonstrate the heterogeneous impacts of climate change on crop suitability.

Current on-farm yields in this region are low and are expected to decrease in response to climate change, through warming and shifts in rainfall. Interventions intended to improve yields and climate adaptation require an understanding of the main drivers of yields across farms.
OBJECTIVE: In this regard, we quantified the extent to which environmental (i.e., climate and soil) conditions drive cocoa yields and how this differs for farms achieving on average low- and high mean production levels based on an unprecedented dataset of 3827 cocoa farms spanning the environmental gradients of Ghana. We further quantified the relative importance of management practices based on a subset of 134 farms for which management information was available.
METHODS: We modelled on-farm annual cocoa yield as a function of environmental variables for the large dataset and cocoa yield per tree as a function of environmental and management variables for the subset farms using mixed-effects models. Differences in effects on yield between farms with low and high mean production levels were evaluated using quantile mixed-effects models.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variability in yields across farms, ranging from ~100 to >1000 kg haâˆ’1 (mean = 554 kg haâˆ’1). Mixed-effects models showed that the fixed effects (i.e., environmental variables) only explained 7% of the variability in yields whilst fixed and random effects together explained 80%, suggesting that farm-to-farm variation played a large role. Explained variation in cocoa yields per tree of 134 farms in the subset increased from 10% to 25% when including management variables in addition to environmental variables. In both models, climate-related factors had a larger effect on yields than edaphic factors, with radiation of the main dry season and that of the previous year having the strongest effects on on-farm- and tree yields, respectively. The quantile Other AI Method analyses showed that productivity in high-yielding farms (90th
percentile) was more strongly driven by environmental factors than in low-yielding farms (10th percentile).
In conclusion, agronomic management is the dominant determinant of on-farm cocoa yields in Ghana, more so than environmental conditions. Furthermore, high-yielding cocoa farms are more sensitive to environmental conditions than low-yielding ones.",Climate change could threaten cocoa production,sustainable intensification plays a key role in climate adaptive strategies,Significant opportunity for farmers to increase yields through improved agronomic management.,climate change;cocoa production;soil;agriculture;uncertainty,"This document discusses various studies focusing on the impacts of climate change on agricultural practices, particularly cocoa production in regions like Brazil and West Africa.

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has plagued production in Africa for over a century. Biparental mapping studies suggest primarily a single major gene mediates resistance. To investigate this genetic architecture, we conducted the first genome-wide association mapping study in cassava with up to 6128 genotyping-by-sequenced African breeding lines and 42,113 reference genome-mapped single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We found a single region on chromosome 8 that accounts for 30 to 66% of genetic resistance in the African cassava germplasm. Thirteen additional regions with small effects were also identified.

While the root dry matter content (RDMC) of this starchy root crop is important for both producers and consumers, characterization of RDMC by traditional methods is time-consuming and laborious for breeding programs. Alternate phenotyping methods have been proposed but lack the accuracy, cost, or speed ultimately needed for cassava breeding programs. For this reason, we investigated the use of a low-cost, handheld near-infrared spectrometer (740â€“1070 nm) for field-based RDMC prediction in cassava.

Therefore, seed demand for different varieties, such as early- or late-maturing cultivars, varies between years. Resulting mismatches between relatively constant supply and variable demand create losses for both seed suppliers and farmers. Because demand for seed of different varieties is influenced by seasonal climate, however, probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasts could help seed suppliers better anticipate upcoming seed demand. To explore this idea, we engaged decision-makers from seed supply organizations in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. Through a participatory design process, we identified opportunities and challenges for using seasonal rainfall forecasts to inform seed supply decisions. In a case study of maize seed sales in Zimbabwe, we tested our assumptions and iteratively devised a systematic procedure for forecast-based planning in seed supply, relying on free online data sources and expert deliberations. We found that currently accessible rainfall forecasts could indeed be useful for prioritizing likely high-demand varieties during the stages of seed treatment, packaging, and logistics. In practice, though, more flexible and adaptive management of seed supply pipelines might be required to make use of seed demand forecasts. In the future, targeting farmers with climate forecasts along with recommended variety portfolios may strengthen the association between seasonal climate and farmersâ€™ variety demand, increasing the accuracy of demand anticipation. This study highlights opportunities for increased case-specific collaboration between climate scientists and the seed sector to make seasonal forecast information operational.",The role of climate forecasts in smallholder agriculture,"Active promotion of seasonally adapted variety portfolios, informed by scenario planning",may help align supply and demand in a way that minimizes risk for both seed suppliers and farmers,agriculture;climate;forecasting;smallholder;food security,"This study examines the demand for maize seeds in Zimbabwe and emphasizes the weak links between seasonal climate scenarios and farmers' seed choices.

This study was conducted to understand the spatial variability of soil properties and delineate spatially homogenous nutrient management zones (MZs) in the maize belt region of Nigeria. Soil samples (n = 3387) were collected across the area using multistage and random sampling techniques, and samples were analyzed for pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), macronutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg), micronutrients (S, B, Zn, Mn and Fe) content, and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). Spatial distribution and variability of these parameters were assessed using geostatistics and ordinary kriging, while principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate K-means cluster analysis were used to delineate nutrient management zones. Results show that spatial variation of macronutrients (total N, available P, and K) was largely influenced by intrinsic factors, while that of S, Ca, ECEC, and most micronutrients was influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors with moderate to high spatial variability. Four distinct management zones, namely, MZ1, MZ2, MZ3, and MZ4, were identified and delineated in the area. MZ1 and MZ4 have the highest contents of most soil fertility indicators.

Litterfall was measured fortnightly close to the base of the cocoa tree and at the edge of the tree canopies from January 2020 to December 2021. Leaf litter decomposition rates were determined over 388 days in 2 mm mesh litterbags to exclude macrofauna and in frames open to the soil surface to allow macrofauna access. Concentrations of C, N, P, and K were measured in the remaining litter at 180, 244, 314, and 388 days after incubation. annual estimates of litterfall (10.62 Mg DM haâˆ’1) did not significantly differ between the traps close to and away from the cocoa tree trunk. Nutrient cycling from litter was estimated at approximately 101 kg N, 5 kg P, and 89 kg K haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1. Relative litter decomposition rates (k) significantly differed between frames and litterbags. Macrofauna access significantly reduced the C:N ratio in the remaining litter and increased N and P loss from the litter layer by 28 and 69%, respectively.

The trials consisted of 10 maize varieties sown at three different sowing densities (2.6, 5.3, and 6.6 plants mâˆ’2) across farmersâ€™ field with contrasting agronomic and nutrient management histories. Model predictions in both years and locations were close to observed data for both calibration and evaluation exercises as evidenced by low normalized root mean square error (RMSE) (â‰¤15%), high modified d-index (> 0.6), and high model efficiency (>0.45) values for the phenology, growth, and yield data across all varieties and agro-ecologies. In both years and locations and for both calibration and evaluation exercises, very good agreements were found between observed and model-simulated grain yields, number of days to physiological maturity, above-ground biomass, and harvest index. Two separate scenario analyses were conducted using the long-term (26 years) weather records for Bunkure (representing the SS) and Zaria (representing the NGS). The early and extra-early varieties were used in the SS while the intermediate and late varieties were used in the NGS. The result of the scenario analyses showed that early and extra-early varieties grown in the SS responds to increased sowing density up to 8.8 plants mâˆ’2 when the recommended rate of N fertilizers (90 kg N haâˆ’1) was applied.

It provides a simple, inexpensive and robust means of conducting in-field diagnosis without requiring an internet connection. Diagnostic tools that do not require the internet are critical for rural settings, especially in Africa where internet penetration is very low. An investigation was conducted in East Africa to evaluate the effectiveness of Nuru as a diagnostic tool by comparing the ability of Nuru, cassava experts (researchers trained on cassava pests and diseases), agricultural extension officers and farmers to correctly identify symptoms of cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) and the damage caused by cassava green mites (CGM). The diagnosis capability of Nuru and that of the assessed individuals was determined by inspecting cassava plants and by using the cassava symptom recognition assessment tool (CaSRAT) to score images of cassava leaves, based on the symptoms present. Nuru could diagnose symptoms of cassava diseases at a higher accuracy (65% in 2020) than the agricultural extension agents (40â€“58%) and farmers (18â€“31%). Nuruâ€™s accuracy in diagnosing cassava disease and pest symptoms, in the field, was enhanced significantly by increasing the number of leaves assessed to six leaves per plant (74â€“88%).

Modelled outputs could be used to complement data from multi-environment trials. Field experiments were conducted in the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016 across four locations in maize growing regions of Northern Nigeria using 16 maize varieties planted under near-optimal conditions of moisture and soil nitrogen. The CERES-Maize model was calibrated using data from three locations and two seasons (rainy and dry) and evaluated using data from one location and two seasons all in 2015. Observed data from the four locations and two seasons in 2016 was used to create eight different environments. Two profile pits were dug in each location and were used separately in the simulations for each environment to provide replicated data for stability analysis in a combined ANOVA. The effects of the environment, genotype and GEI were highly significant (pâ€¯=â€¯0.001) for both observed and simulated grain yields. The environment explained 67 % and 64 % of the variations in observed and simulated grain yields respectively. The variance component of GEI (13 % for observed and 15 % for simulated) were lower but still considerable when compared to that of genotypes (19 % for observed and 21 % for simulated).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted on social capital elements to derive social capital dimensions. Results show that group membership and relations to leadership positively influenced the adoption of CA. Furthermore, cultivated land, extension services, livestock ownership, and access to credit had a positive influence on the number of CA practices adopted. Although the effect on full CA adoption is minimal compared to partial adoption, results demonstrate favorable trends toward full CA adoption. We also used Seemingly Unrelated Other AI Methods (SUR) to investigate determinants of participation in social networks. Findings show that the number of training a farmer receives is the main determinant across all dimensions of social capital.

Two sets of trials were conducted side by side, one with an open pollinated maize variety (OPV) and the other one with a hybrid maize variety and each set had six equal treatments laid out in 198 farmersâ€™ fields. The treatments comprised (i) a control, (ii) a PK (â€˜âˆ’N,â€™ without N), (iii) an NK (â€˜âˆ’P,â€™ without P), (iv) an NP (â€˜âˆ’K,â€™ without K), (v) an NPK and (vi) an NPK + S + Ca + Mg + Zn + B (â€˜+SMM,â€™ NPK plus secondary macro- and micro-nutrients). Moderate to a large variability in most soil characteristics was observed in the studied fields. Consequently, cluster analysis revealed three distinct yield-nutrient response classes common for the two types of maize varieties. These define classes were fields that have (i) no-response to any nutrient, (ii) a large response to N and P and (iii) a large response to N alone. Although overall yield performance of OPV and hybrid varieties was similar, a distinct fourth class was identified for the hybrid variety, (iv) fields with a large response to N and secondary macro- and micro-nutrients.

By leveraging mobile technology and a centralized database, the SNS has streamlined the Rwandan governmentâ€™s subsidy allocation process, enabling over 1.9 million farmers to access essential inputs like fertilizers and seeds. The systemâ€™s real-time data tracking, farmer empowerment tools, and market development initiatives have fostered transparency, efficiency, and inclusivity in the agricultural sector. Despite its successes, the SNS faces challenges in areas such as digital supply chain management, financial processes, and user experience. These challenges highlight the need for continuous improvement and adaptation to ensure the systemâ€™s long-term sustainability and effectiveness. The â€œSynchronized Scaling of Digital Fertilizer Advisory for Six Crops through Rwandaâ€™s Smart Nkunganire Systemâ€ project under the CGIAR Research Initiative Diversification for Resilient Agrifood Systems in East and Southern Africa (Ukama Ustawi) and Excellence in Agronomy (EiA) both supported by CGIAR led by International Potato Center (CIP) and other partners, aimed to address these challenges and explore optimal delivery/business models for the next phase of the SNSâ€™s development.
The assessment of various delivery/business models revealed that the SNS currently aligns most strongly with the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Mobile-First approaches. The PPP model has been instrumental in the systemâ€™s successful implementation, while the mobile-first design has enhanced its accessibility and reach. However, there is potential for the SNS to evolve further by incorporating elements of other models, such as tiered services and data monetization, to create a more personalized and impactful experience for farmers.
The future of the SNS is promising. By addressing existing challenges, leveraging its data-driven insights, and exploring innovative business models, the SNS can continue to empower farmers, drive agricultural transformation, and contribute to Rwandaâ€™s food security and economic growth. The key lies in fostering collaboration, investing in capacity building, and maintaining a steadfast commitment to user-centric design.

Urban dwellers are particularly affected by this process that influences public health and habitat conservation. We explored the extinction of experience among the urban populace in Nigeria, a clear Global South representative with rapidly increasing human population. We interviewed 600 adults from several cities and performed statistical tests. Results show that most respondents have no contact nor connection with nature, revealing an important distancing from the natural world. The reasons respondents gave for not experiencing nature more often are mainly related to material terms (e.g., lack of time, money and nearby natural areas). We found that respondents with higher nature contact are also more connected to nature, which is promoted by the perception of neighborhood safety. Respondents living in Lagos, and those with lower levels of income and education show greater dissociation from nature.

The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa;CONTEXT
The accessibility and availability of forages is a common concern in crop-livestock systems in West Africa;however, options to increase forage production may entail trade-offs within the farm system that can be challenging to quantify explicitly.

OBJECTIVE
This study examined how maize (Zea mays L.) leaf stripping affected maize and sheep productivity and associated labour requirements, and farm system trade-offs and synergies in four communities in the Northern Region of Ghana.

METHODS
Maize leaf stripping involved removing almost senesced leaves from maize plants below the cob level at silking. We combined data from three sources: on-farm maize trials with 28 farmers from two seasons (2017 and 2018), on-farm sheep feeding trials where the pasture-based diets of weaner sheep were supplemented with stripped maize leaves fed in pens (conducted in 2019), and farm survey data from 117 households (conducted in 2014), seven of which were in the on-farm maize trials and owned sheep. We examined the trial data using linear mixed-effects models.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Maize leaf stripping had no significant effect on maize grain yield but had a significant positive effect on maize forage protein yield from leaf and stover. Offering maize leaves to weaner sheep had a significant positive effect on average daily liveweight gain, estimated marginal mean was 29.3 g with maize leaves and âˆ’10.9 g without maize leaves. For the maize-sheep systems of the seven households, non-inferential statistics suggested that on average maize leaf stripping reduced total maize grain production by 12% (range âˆ’46 to 38) and increased maize forage protein production from leaf and stover by 90% (range âˆ’16 to 298). Stripping the maize leaves from one hectare of land took an extra 34 h (range 27 to 42) of labour, which was counterbalanced by reduced labour time for grazing as sheep were fed the maize leaves in pens. For the 117 farmers, heterogeneity in maize areas planted and livestock numbers resulted in heterogeneous production and labour effects of maize leaf stripping. Farmers qualitatively described how maize leaf stripping released labour so children could spend more time at school rather than shepherding.

SIGNIFICANCE
We quantified in northern Ghana how maize leaf stripping altered crop and livestock productivity and associated trade-offs and synergies in the farm system, including labour. Changes in crop management often have implications beyond the crop's field and examining these implications can provide insights into the suitability of alternative farm management options.

The findings reveal that while both male and female farmers adopt improved soybean varieties, fertilizer, and herbicides, the intensity of adoption varies due to differences in socioeconomic constraints. Male farmers demonstrated slightly higher adoption rates across all practices, particularly for herbicide use. However, financial and market-related barriers, such as high input costs and distance to seed markets, disproportionately hindered female farmers' ability to fully integrate improved practices into their farming activities. The analysis indicates that the adoption of improved soybean varieties by male farmers was mainly influenced by income and pest/disease constraints, whereas female farmers were more affected by age, extension visits, and community tenure. Herbicide use among male farmers was driven by farm size and input costs, while for female farmers, it was influenced by education, input costs, and proximity to seed markets. Fertilizer adoption among male farmers was linked to income and farming experience, whereas female farmers' fertilizer use was shaped by farm size and financial constraints. Ordered probit Other AI Method results suggest that age negatively affects adoption intensity for both genders, but income and community tenure play a stronger role for men, while market access and cost barriers are more significant for women. Improving access to extension services can significantly enhance adoption rates, especially for female farmers who face higher input costs and limited access to seed markets. Targeted subsidies and credit programs tailored to smallholder farmers will help alleviate financial barriers, enabling both men and women to invest in essential inputs and expand production. Strengthening rural infrastructure, including better road networks and input market accessibility, will further reduce logistical challenges and support increased soybean cultivation.","female farmers face additional barriers, including limited access to credit, extension services, and proximity to input markets",the local extension service should expand its reach to improve adoption rates among all farmers,"Expanding financial support mechanisms, such as credit programs tailored to smallholder farmers, will enable both male and female farmers to invest in essential inputs and scale up their production",gender;agriculture;adoption;innovation;sustainability,"This collection of publications discusses various aspects of soybean agriculture, focusing on the implications for women farmers in regions like Nigeria and Ghana.

Global cocoa production is largely concentrated in West Africa where over 70% of cocoa is produced. Here, cocoa farming is largely a rain-fed, low-input system with low average yields, which are expected to decline with climate change. With increasing demand, there is a need to evaluate opportunities to increase production whilst avoiding deforestation and expansion to croplands. Thus, it is important to know how much additional cocoa can be produced on existing farmland, and what factors determine this potential for increased yield.

OBJECTIVE
The objective was to quantify the cocoa yield gap in Ghana and identify the factors that can contribute to narrowing the gap.

METHODS
We calculated the cocoa yield gap as the difference between potential yield (i. water-limited potential(Yw) quantified using a crop model, ii. attainable yield in high-input systems(YE), iii. attainable yield in low-input systems(YF)) and actual farmer yield. Both absolute and relative yield gaps were calculated. We then related each yield gap (absolute & relative) as a function of environment and management variables using mixed-effects models.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
There were considerable yield gaps on all cocoa farms. Maximum water-limited yield gaps (YGW) were very large with a mean absolute gap of 4577 kg/ha representing 86% of Yw. Attainable yield gap in high-input (YGE) was lower with mean absolute gap of 1930 kg/ha representing 73% of YE. The yield gap in low-input (YGF) was even lower with mean absolute gap of 469 kg/ha representing 42% of YF. Mixed-effects models showed that, absolute YGW were larger at sites with higher precipitation in the minor wet and minimum temperature in the minor dry season explaining 22% of the variability in YGW. These same factors and cocoa planting density explained 28% of variability in absolute YGE. Regardless of climate, absolute YGF and relative YGW, YGE and YGF were reduced by increasing cocoa planting density and application of fungicide against black pod. The models explained 25% of the variability in absolute YGF, and 33%, 33% and 25% in relative YGW, YGE and YGF respectively.

In conclusion, climate determined absolute YGW in Ghana whilst absolute YGE were determined by both climate and management. In contrast, absolute YGF and relative YGW, YGE and YGF can be reduced by agronomic management practices.

SIGNIFICANCE
Our study is one of the first to quantify cocoa yield gaps in West Africa and shows that these can be closed by improved agronomic practices.","Climate change, cocoa migrations and deforestation in West Africa: what does the past tell us about the future?",Fostering a climate-smart intensification for oil palm.,offer opportunities to substantially increase production in present-day cocoa farms,cocoa;climate change;deforestation;sustainability;agriculture,"This publication discusses the implications of climate change on cocoa production in West Africa, emphasizing how past patterns can inform future strategies to combat the challenges of climate adaptation and migration of cocoa farms.",https://hdl.handle.net/10568/120413

Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term â€˜agronomic gainâ€™ based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety Ã— agronomic practice Ã— environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.",Participatory diagnostic for scaling a decision support tool for rice crop management,decision support tool for rice crop management,"Facilitate developing, evaluating, and scaling new innovations with proposed agronomic gain assessment to achieve their widespread adoption by different end users based on their needs and preferences.",rice;management;Africa;decision support;participatory,"This publication discusses the participatory diagnostic approach used for scaling a decision support tool aimed at improving rice crop management in northern Nigeria, highlighting the importance of involving local farmers in the development process.",https://hdl.handle.net/10568/114408

We measured GHG fluxes from intact soil cores collected in Rakai, Uganda, an area characterized by lowâ€input smallholder (<2 ha) farming systems, typical for the East African highlands. The soil cores were air dried and rewetted to water holding capacities (WHCs) of 30, 55, and 80%. Soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured for 48 h following rewetting. Cumulative N2O fluxes were highest from soils under perennial crops and the lowest from soils under annual crops (P < 0.001 for all WHC). At WHC of 55% or 80%, the sandy clay loam soils had lower N2O fluxes than the clay soils (P < 0.001 and P = 0.041, respectively). Cumulative soil CO2 fluxes were highest from eucalyptus plantations and lowest from annual crops across multiple WHC (P = 0.014 at 30% WHC and P < 0.001 at both 55 and 80% WHC). Methane fluxes were below detectable limits, a shortcoming for using soil cores from the top soil. This study reveals that land use and soil type have strong effects on GHG fluxes from agricultural land in the study area.

While its initial conception revolved around managing zoonotic diseases as they traverse the interface between animals and humans through the environment, this concept has transformed beyond its origins as a collaboration solely between veterinary and public health stakeholders. Notably, the past decade has ushered in a new era of addressing complex issues in a novel manner. Emerging evidence has led to a fresh theoretical framework, highlighting interconnected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Additionally, integrating citizen science into variety development can enhance variety adoption and suitability for smallholder farmers. We assessed the insights from a crop trial following a triadic comparison of technology options (tricot) approach, linking the results with environmental, socio-economic, and on-station trial data. Under a tricot trial, 460 farmers tested eleven potato varieties, randomly allocated in incomplete blocks of three, allowing each farmer to test and compare three varieties. Biological data, reflecting breeding and variety genotypic values, were generated from multi-environmental tests conducted during 2018â€“2019 to evaluate the adaptability of new varieties. This research revealed that Rwandan farmers preferred the pre-1990 varieties (Cruza and Kirundo), while Gisubizo and Kazeneza, post-2018 varieties, were also considered competitive. Farmersâ€™ preferences were influenced by diverse environmental and socio-economic conditions, with taste being crucial for home consumption and yield prioritized for market sales. Additionally, seasonal temperatures influenced the yield performance ranking of potato varieties across regions, while economic considerations and gender dynamics shaped different patterns of variety preferences. Despite challenges in aligning on-station and on-farm data, our integrated approach provides actionable insights for breeding programmes to develop potato varieties that better align with farmersâ€™ needs, as well as environmental and socio-economic conditions.

Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into todayâ€™s elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, floweringâ€“maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new speciesâ€™ domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in â€œomicsâ€ sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.","legumes are cultivated less owing to their several undesirable traits such as pod shattering, late flowering, and indeterminate growth habit",CRISPR/Cas9 can precisely edit genes to improve genotypes and aid in accelerating the domestication process of new crops,facilitate a sustainable agriculture system for accelerating crop genetic diversity and improving global food production,legumes;domestication;genetics;agriculture;innovation,"This publication discusses the domestication of food legumes, emphasizing the importance of identifying superior genotypes through advanced scientific tools such as molecular markers and genomics-assisted selection.

To achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), food security must be prioritized. Rice yield has been predicted using Cubist, GBM, MARS, RF, SVM, and XGB machine learning methods, considering six factors: elevation, soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, soil temperature, and actual evapotranspiration. Climatic change scenarios were generated using the latest climatic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6 MIROC6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2â€“4.5 and SSP5-8.5 datasets between 1990 and 2030. Finally, machine learning algorithms were used to identify rice yield gaps to achieve sustainable agricultural intensification. The rice yield validation was completed with 1889 field-based farmer observation records. The results suggest that Murshidabad and Purba Bardhaman districts had very high rice yields (5.60â€“3.45 t/ha) when using the Cubist model compared to another model. The findings also reveal a poor rice-yielding zone (1.44â€“0.39 t/ha) in the western region (Purulia) and a northwestern region (half of the west of Birbhum). The Cubist and RF models' maximum and minimum R2 values were 0.73 and 0.72, respectively. The R2 values were also negligible for the XGB, GBM, SVM, and MARS, machine learning models. Projections for rice production in 2030 indicate that the northern and north-eastern regions (Murshidabad and Purba Bardhaman) as well as the southeastern areas (Jhargram and Paschim Medinipur) have the highest yields, categorized as extremely very high (5.56â€“3.49 t/ha) and high (3.49â€“2.49 t/ha).

Field observations showed that leaf blight severity was approx. 54%, whereas the coastal area isolates gave high disease severity (61.5%), followed by the central area isolates (56%). The pathogenicity tests showed that all the isolates were pathogenic to wheat under greenhouse conditions, with 63% of ranked as highly virulent. The PCR results confirmed that the isolates were P. syringae pv. syringae.

However, at any specific location only a few of these pathogens are of economic concern. Yield losses resulting from virus attack vary widely, from little, as in the case of Broad bean mottle virus in Tunisia and Morocco, to complete crop failure when conditions permit widespread virus infection at the vulnerable early plant growth stage, as with Faba bean necrotic yellows virus in Egypt and Syria. Cereal crops (wheat, barley and oat) in Arab and Mediterranean regions are also affected by viruses, mainly Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV, and this virus is reported to occur at epidemic levels in only Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Epidemic spread of most viral diseases was always associated with high vector populations and activity. Although virus disease management can be achieved through the combined effects of several approaches, development of resistant genotypes is one of the most promising control components. Experience over the last few decades has clearly showed that no single method of virus disease control reduces yield losses in legume crops. Some progress was made on the disease management of some legume and cereal viruses using combinations of healthy seed, host resistance, cultural practices (such as adjustments of planting date and plant density, and roguing of infected plants early in the season) and chemical control virus vectors.","A severe disease of cactus pear was reported on the minor Sicilian islands of Lampedusa and Linosa (Pelagie archipelago), Favignana (Aegadian archipelago), and Ustica.","Evaluation of liquid formulation fungicide (pyraclostrobin + boscalid) and paste treatments, as well as biological control agents (Trichoderma atroviride SC1, T. atroviride I-1237, or T. asperellum ICC012 + T. gamsii ICC080).",Potential to prevent natural infections of grapevine pruning wounds by trunk disease fungi.,Opuntia ficus-indica;Neofusicoccum batangarum;scabby canker;Sicilian islands;agriculture,"This research investigates the severe disease known as 'scabby canker' affecting Opuntia ficus-indica in Sicilian islands.

there is poor estimation of yield for most smallholders due to lack of technology, and field scale data,
particularly in Egypt. Automated machine learning (AutoML) can be used to automate the machine
learning workflow, including automatic training and optimization of multiple models within a userspecified
time frame, but it has less attention so far. Here, we combined extensive field survey yield
across wheat cultivated area in Egypt with diverse dataset of remote sensing, soil, and weather to
predict field-level wheat yield using 22 Ml models in AutoML. The models showed robust accuracies
for yield predictions, recording Willmott degree of agreement, (d>0.80) with higher accuracy when
super learner (stacked ensemble) was used (R2=0.51, d=0.82). The trained AutoML was deployed to
predict yield using remote sensing (RS) vegetative indices (VIs), demonstrating a good correlation
with actual yield (R2=0.7). This is very important since it is considered a low-cost tool and could be
used to explore early yield predictions. Since climate change has negative impacts on agricultural
production and food security with some uncertainties, AutoML was deployed to predict wheat yield

range of rainfall patterns, mainly characterized by drought due to poor rainfall distribution within
the season. Large disparities in attainable yield and profit gaps have been reported, and closing
these gaps is important for meeting domestic demand and reducing imports. The main aim of this
study was to determine field- and landscape-level yield and yield gaps for wheat and its drivers in
the Central region of Morocco using ground information, remote sensing and machine learning
approaches. To this end, we prepared a time series map of six vegetation indices (EVI2, CGVI, MSR,
NDVI, OSAVI, and RVI) derived from Sentinel-2 images (10 m) over three consecutive crop seasons
(2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021). Vegetation indices datasets were combined with the
climate, soil, and crop management, and the random forest model was calibrated and validated for
each cropping season. The models that gave good performance were applied to predict actual yield,
potential yield, and the yield gaps at the plot level. The models were used for mapping yield at the
regional scale, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region of Morocco. Based on those datasets, the main drivers of
this gap were determined. The findings reveal that RVI, EVI2, and GCVI vegetation indices well
predicted wheat yield for the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 seasons with R2 of 0.869, 0.863,
and 0.844, respectively. The predicted rainfed potential wheat yields were 5.99, 1.53, and 4.66 t per
ha, respectively for three crop seasons. Combined over all three seasons, the most important yield
determinants are soil moisture, cumulative rainfall during the crop growing period, followed by
actual evapotranspiration, and silt content of the soil. When combining soil, climate and
management practices in 2019-2020, the major determinants are still soil moisture and the variables
of climate followed by the management practices and soil texture. The results and maps produced
are of great importance for predicting wheat yield in advance using in-season vegetation indices
which is important for the farmers and policymakers for planning at regional and national scales.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/128099

In the last decades, the major constraints were often related to the countryâ€™s Mediterranean-type climate, through the intense recurrence of drought events and high inter- and intra-annual rainfall fluctuations. Similarly, various forms of soil degradation inhibit the potential of this slowly renewable resource to support wheat crop intensification and ensure livelihoods. However, the limitations sometimes surpass the environmental factors to implicate the inappropriate crop management strategies applied by farmers. In Moroccan rainfed areas, production problems linked to crop management practices result principally from a shortage in the provision of knowledge to Moroccan small farmers, or their indigent economic situation that limits farmersâ€™ capacity to adopt, qualitatively and quantitatively, efficient strategies. Advanced technologies (remote sensing or crop modeling) play key roles in assessing wheat cropping systems in Moroccan rainfed areas. Due to the difficulties of using conventional experience-based agronomic research to understand Genotype Ã— Environment Ã— Management (G Ã— E Ã— M) interactions, the substantial benefits of crop modeling approaches present a better alternative to provide insights. They allow the provision of simpler, rapid, less expensive, deep, and potentially more accurate predictive knowledge and understanding of the status of cropping systems. In the present study, we highlight the constraints that surround wheat cropping systems in Moroccan rainfed conditions. We emphasize the efficiency of applying crop modelling to analyze and improve wheat cropping systems through three main themes: (i) preserving food security, (ii) supporting general adaptation strategies to face climate change effects and extreme events, and (iii) recommending within-season and on-farm crop management advice. Under Moroccan context, crop modeling works have mainly contributed to increase understanding and address the climate change effects on wheat productivity.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is among the most important staple food crops in the lowland Terai region of Nepal. However, national production has not matched the increasing demand. From a South Asian regional perspective, average productivity is low with high spatial and temporal variability.

OBJECTIVES
This study determines entry points for closing yield gaps using multiple diagnostic approaches, i.e., field surveys, on-farm experiments, and simulation models across different wheat production environments in the Terai region of Nepal.

METHODOLOGY
Yield and production practice data were collected from 1745 wheat farmers' fields and analysed in tandem with over 100 on-farm experiments. These were complemented by long-term simulation modeling using the APSIM Next Generation to assess system production behavior over a range of climate years.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
On-farm survey data suggests that yield and profit gaps under farmers' management (difference between the most productive (top 10th decile) and average wheat fields) were 1.60 t haâˆ’1 and 348 USD haâˆ’1 in the Terai region. The potential yield gap (difference between simulated potential yield and surveyed population mean) estimated was 4.63 t haâˆ’1, suggesting ample room for growth even for the highest-yielding fields. Machine learning diagnostics of survey data, and on-farm trials identified nitrogen rate, irrigation management, terminal heat stress, use of improved varieties, seeding date, seeding method, and seeding rate as the principal agronomic drivers of wheat yield. While fields in the top 10th decile yield distribution had higher fertilizer use efficiencies and irrigation and seeding rates with similar overall production costs as average-yielding farmers. Our results suggest a complementary set of agronomic interventions to increase wheat productivity among lower-yielding farms in the Terai including advancing the time of seeding by 7â€“10 days on average, increasing nitrogen fertilizer by 20 kg haâˆ’1, and alleviating water stress by applying two additional irrigations.

SIGNIFICANCE
Although wheat yields in the Terai are among the lowest in the region, biophysical production potential is high and remains largely untapped due to sub-optimal agronomic management practices rather than intrinsic agroecological factors. Data from this study suggests that incremental changes in these practices may result in substantial gains in productivity and profitability.","Agronomic, socio-economic, and environmental challenges and opportunities in Nepalâ€™s cereal-based farming systems.","A mixed-methods approach that combines household surveys, on-farm experiments, and long-term crop simulation.",Wheat farmers in Nepal can be better placed to match improved yield with profitability.,sustainability;agriculture;climate adaptation;food security;rice cultivation,"This publication discusses the agronomic, socio-economic, and environmental challenges faced in cereal-based farming systems in Nepal, highlighting opportunities for improvement.",https://hdl.handle.net/10568/134892

landscape. It is the major component of the national diet and an essential contributor to food security.
Its cultivation in the country has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The Nile Delta has always
been an ideal location for wheat cultivation. Historically, Egypt was known as the â€œBreadbasket of the
Roman Empireâ€, highlighting its crucial role in sustaining its population and neighbouring regions. In
the country, compared to all crops, it is grown in the largest area (1.33 million ha) and the country
produces 9.1 million tons of wheat (average productivity of 6.81 t ha-1) (Source: Economic Affairs
Sector, Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, 2023). Compared to all crops, its cultivation
area is increasing in the country. However, it is meeting 50% of the demand from the international
market to fill the gap between production and consumption (5.86 million t, one of the top 10th largest
importers), where the import value of wheat and wheat products was 2.49 billion USD in 2021
(FAOSTAT, 2023).
In recent years (2018-2021), Egypt has shown prominence in reducing imports, where it imported
9.53 million tons wheat in 2021/2022 while it decreased by 17.5% (7.86 million tons) in 2022/2023
(Source: Agriculture Economic Research Institute (AERC). However, to reduce imports sustainably,
the country might need to adopt both approaches, i.e., area expansion in New Land and sustainably
closing the yield gap in the Old Lands. Adopting science-led demand-driven and sustainable
(economic, environmental, and social) farming practices, including improved crop varieties and
efficient agronomic management practices, is the key for the sustainable intensification of wheat
production in both new and old lands. By implementing below climate-smart wheat production

This indicates the urgent need for demand-led agricultural interventions for improving cereals productivity for food security. Crop simulation models and DSS tools have potential to predict potential yields, identify yield gaps, and help make decisions for improved crop, nutrient, water and pest management. Models can assess the impact of climate change, and help develop adaptation and mitigation measures to lesses the impact of climate change. To date, no review work has been conducted on the potential applications of crop simulation models and their relevance in Nepal. The objective of this chapter is to review and synthesize the relevant studies on the development and application of crop simulation models for major cereal crops: rice, wheat, and maize. We reviewed around 95 published papers and reports from South Asia and Nepal available in Scopus, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect using the Google search engine. Analysis revealed that yield gaps (potential minus farmers' field yields) of 4.9â€“9.0, 3.1â€“6.9, and 4.5â€“12.5 t haâˆ’1 exist in rice, wheat, and maize crops, respectively. For achieving self-sufficiency in cereal grains, the average national productivity of rice, wheat, and maize needs to be increased to 5.7, 3.9, and 4.9 t haâˆ’1, respectively by 2030. Based on the review, climate change has both positive and negative consequences on cereal production across all agro-ecological zones. Crop simulation models have been applied for enhancing crop productivity and exploring adaptation strategies for climate change resilience. Models can generate various recommendations related to biophysical factors: crop, water, tillage, nutrient, and pest management, crop yield, and weather forecasting. Furthermore, models have shown the potential to determine the effects of climate change on crop productivity across a range of environments in Nepal. In conclusion, crop simulation models could be useful decision support tools for policy planning and implementation, increasing efficiency in research, prioritizing research and extension interventions for increasing crop yields, and the way forward to achieve food and nutritional security and some of the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly #1, #2 and #13).","Improved nutrient management in cereals using nutrient expert and machine learning tools: productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiency.",Improved nutrient management in cereals using nutrient expert and machine learning tools,These can serve as alternative and more efficient DSS tools for research and extension and in providing reliable guidance to policymakers in policy assessment and design.,crop rotation;simulation model;food security;nutrition;climate change,"This publication focuses on the improved management of nutrients in cereal crops through the application of machine learning tools and nutrient expert systems, aiming to enhance productivity and profitability while increasing nutrient use efficiency.",https://hdl.handle.net/10568/127317

Leaf miner (Liriomyza cicerina) is a pest that can cause severe yield losses of up to 40% if not properly controlled. This study was conducted at ICARDA (Aleppo, Syria) during the 20112012 growing seasons. Two recombinant inbred lines, ILC 5901 (LM resistant) and ILC 3397 (LM susceptible), were crossed to yield 350 F2 plants, which were then screened for pathogen tolerance. The resistance of the plants was screened using a scale of one to nine, with 1 indicating complete resistance and 9 indicating complete susceptibility. A set of 600 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were validated on both parents, and 51 of these markers showed variation and were used to construct a genetic linkage map. QTL analysis was performed to determine the linkage groups responsible for line variations. The QTL analysis found that linkage groups TA37, TA34, and H4F03 were responsible for 22% of line variations, while unmapped NCPRG48 and H1C092 revealed 55.3% and 26.8% of the LIS variance, respectively, and displayed a warped dominance toward the susceptible parent. The H1C092 marker, which is significantly associated with LM, is located on Chr3 near a gene encoding the glutathione S-transferase gene family enzyme, which protects cellular macromolecules from attack by reactive electrophiles. The highly associated markers were field tested for three years to confirm their connection with LM resistance in 200 chickpea genotypes. The study showed marker-associated selection, which could accelerate the conventional breeding of LM-resistant chickpea germplasm. The markers linked to LM resistance and the identification of the protective enzyme gene o er promising avenues for further research. This study represents a significant step forward in understanding the genetics of LM resistance in chickpea and provides valuable information for breeding programs aimed at improving chickpea production.",Improving breeding programmes to strengthen resources against current and future plant pathogen impacts is crucial.,"This is the first report for SSR markers associated with LM resistance in chickpea, which may help in guiding and enhancing the use of marker assisted selection to speed up the conventional breeding of LM resistance in chickpea.",Our findings suggest that these markers can be used to identify elite chickpea genotypes.,chickpea;LM resistance;SSR markers;breeding;QTLs,"This publication presents the first report of SSR markers associated with leaf miner (LM) resistance in chickpea, validating potential QTLs over a three-year period.

But, the question remains â€˜to what extent can breeding gains be achieved under a changing climate, at a pace sufficient to usefully contribute to climate adaptation, mitigation and food security?â€™. Here, we address this question by critically reviewing how model-based approaches can be used to assist breeding activities, with particular focus on all CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR) breeding programs. Crop modeling can underpin breeding efforts in many different ways, including assessing genotypic adaptability and stability, characterizing and identifying target breeding environments, identifying tradeoffs among traits for such environments, and making predictions of the likely breeding value of the genotypes. Crop modeling science within the CGIAR has contributed to all of these. However, much progress remains to be done if modeling is to effectively contribute to more targeted and impactful breeding programs under changing climates. In a period in which CGIAR breeding programs are undergoing a major modernization process, crop modelers will need to be part of crop improvement teams, with a common understanding of breeding pipelines and model capabilities and limitations, and common data standards and protocols, to ensure they follow and deliver according to clearly defined breeding products. This will, in turn, enable more rapid and better-targeted crop modeling activities, thus directly contributing to accelerated and more impactful breeding efforts.",Climate change impacts and potential benefits of drought and heat tolerance,Next generation crop models: A modular approach to model early vegetative and reproductive development of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L).,More rapid and better targeted crop model improvement activities.,climate change;drought tolerance;heat tolerance;chickpea;sorghum,"This article discusses CGIAR modeling approaches aimed at accelerating crop breeding to adapt to changing climate conditions.

Early detection of land degradation could help to avoid further deterioration and work on reversing the trend. This would require an integrated approach combining indicators such as vegetation condition, soil health (i.e., soil salinity), and soil exposure (i.e., albedo) to characterize land degradation comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims at developing a satellite image-based combined land degradation index to monitor the spatial extent of land degradation in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. In addition, the study also evaluates the environmental change associated with land degradation across the Tana-Beles watershed. The combined land degradation index (CLDI) was developed by integrating multiple indicators, including normalized vegetation Index (NDVI), salinity index (SI), and albedo, for two periods spanning between 1990 and 2000 (1990s) and 2010 to 2020 (2010s). The individual indicators were combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by assigning weights to the individual indicators.

Many attempts to improve sandy soil properties have been attempted using soil amendments, but further research is needed to explore the combined impact of cost-effective amendments. To that purpose, we investigated the impact of various soil amendments, including single and combination applications of synthetic Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP), compost, and biochar, on sandy soil physiochemical characteristics and bean (Vicia faba L.) production and quality throughout three growing seasons. In a randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment, different treatments such as control (without application), lower dose of SAP (SAP1), higher dose of SAP (SAP2), biochar, compost, SAP1 plus biochar, SAP1 plus compost, SAP2 plus biochar, SAP2 plus compost, and biochar plus compost were used. The combined treatments, such as SAP2 plus biochar (T8), SAP2 plus compost (T9), and biochar plus compost (T10), improved soil physiochemical characteristics and crop production significantly. Application of T10 decreased soil bulk density by 15%, 17%, and 13% while increasing soil available water by 10%, 6%, and 3% over the first, second, and third growing seasons, respectively, compared to untreated soil (T1).

The study identified 52 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for STB resistance at maturity (SDSM) and 62 MTAs at heading (SDSH). Chromosome 5A contains a high concentration of MTAs that confer resistance to STB, hosting multiple significant MTAs, including four consistently associated markers (â€˜Kukri_c10033_724â€™, â€˜RAC875_rep_c116420_103â€™, â€˜TG0019â€™, and â€˜RAC875_c30566_230â€™). Additionally, chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5B, and 7A were found to harbor important MTAs, contributing to resistance across various environments. Notably, two QTLs, qtSTB23 (5A) and qtSTB38 (7B), exhibited stability across multiple environments, making them robust candidates for breeding programs. Furthermore, novel resistance loci on chromosome 2A were discovered, offering new opportunities for enhancing resistance. Therefore, these findings provide an opportunity for improving STB resistance through gene stacking using marker-assisted selection (MAS).",economically devastating disease,development of Z. tritici-resistant wheat genotypes in breeding programs,facilitating the selection and development of improved wheat varieties with enhanced resistance against STB,Septoria;wheat;resistance;genetics;agriculture,"This study presents a genome-wide association analysis of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) for adult plant resistance in bread wheat.

Food production and consumption drive environmental change with greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and land-system shifts. The climate change crisis has intensified concerns about the ecological impact of these systems. Sustainable food networks, such as community-supported agriculture, are promoting sustainable production and consumption through short supply chains. International bodies like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) are also spearheading initiatives for more equitable and sustainable food systems. In Tunisia, where dryland areas predominate, the ongoing implementation of the Agroecology Initiative provides the context for this study, which explores the drivers and barriers of agroecological transformation in this challenging environment. The research focuses on stakeholder engagement, with a gender perspective to explore farmer perceptions. The study, conducted in the northwest of Tunisia in 2022â€“2023, involved focus groups, workshops, surveys, and questionnaires with various stakeholders. Findings highlight farmer organizationsâ€™ potential in promoting sustainable farming, with clear goals, diversified systems, and collaborations. However, challenges such as input scarcity, water shortage, low income, and marketing must be addressed. Results also indicate that over 90% of farmers who received assistance with agroecological practices reported a change in their ideas and practices. Fifty seven percent of the workshops participants identified the olive oil value chain as having the greatest potential for agroecological transformation, but it faces constraints such as climate, lack of policy incentives, training, funding, and difficulty in adopting technical innovations. Womenâ€™s inclusion in agriculture, environmental, social, and economic challenges were also highlighted. Despite these obstacles, key drivers for agroecological transition were identified. These include the compatibility of many agroecological practices with existing farmer capabilities, their cultural and economic benefits, and the positive outcomes for environmental sustainability and health. The study advocates for a socio-technical systems analysis to address the root causes hindering Tunisiaâ€™s agroecological transformation. A participatory approach is crucial to understanding priorities and developing a sustainable and resilient food system. Furthermore, the research underscores the
importance of considering diverse farmer perspectives and tailoring strategies to support this critical transition effectively.",Impacts of climate change on cereal farming in Tunisia,Development of capacity building programs to equip farmers with the necessary knowledge and skills to embrace agroecological practices.,Enhance food security and foster innovation in Tunisia.,value chain;medicinal plants;sustainable development;SWOT analysis;bioeconomy,"This publication discusses the CGIAR Initiative on Agroecology, focusing on different pathways to transitioning agroecologically across eight countries.

In the present study, genetic architecture of grain micronutrients (grain iron and zinc concentration) and anti-nutritional factors (grain phytic acid and tannin content) in association mapping panel of 145 diverse mungbean were evaluated.
Based on all four parameters genotypes PUSA 1333 and IPM 02-19 were observed as desired genotypes as they had high grain iron and zinc concentration but low grain phytic acid and tannin content. The next generation sequencing (NGS)-based genotyping by sequencing (GBS) identified 14,447 genome-wide SNPs in a diverse selected panel of 127 mungbean genotypes. Population admixture analysis revealed the presence of four different ancestries among the genotypes and LD decay of âˆ¼57.6 kb kb physical distance was noted in mungbean chromosomes. Association mapping analysis revealed that a total of 20 significant SNPs were shared by both GLM and Blink models associated with grain micronutrient and anti-nutritional factor traits, with Blink model identifying 35 putative SNPs.

Any land-use practice or change to obtain a particular ecosystem service affects the other ES positively or negatively. The dynamics of these changes is more marked in biodiversity hotspot areas like UNESCO registered Yayo coffee forest biosphere reserve in southwestern Ethiopia. We used a time series InVEST modeling framework to estimate six ESs and analyze their spatial and temporal dynamics due to land-use/cover change over the last 31 years. Pearson correlation coefficients and k-mean clustering were employed to analyze tradeoffs/synergies and to cluster ESs supply spatially. The analysis also considers land-use change impact in the three management zones (core, transition and buffer) of the Yayo biosphere area. The production efficient frontier is used to identify the optimal combination of ESs and to suggest where an increase of one ES is possible without decreasing the others. Mostly, the highest change is observed in the transition zone followed by buffer zones. Positive correlation (synergies) are observed between regulating ecosystem services. Negative correlations (tradeoffs) are observed between provision ecosystem services. The clustering analysis shows that the spatial ESs can be divided in two clusters (bundle): cluster 1 with â€œHigh regulating ESsâ€ that can be characterized by core zone and some forest patches in the central part of the biosphere reserve, and cluster 2 with â€œHigh provisioning ESs areas'' that can be characterized by cultivated lands at transition and buffer zones. The result shows that the existing ES pairs are far from the Pareto efficient combination(s), confirming that landscape optimization for ES bundles are rarely possible on the ground due to many reasons and indicating the need for well thought land restoration strategies and land management practices that are forest type and context specific.","tradeoffs existed between increasing crop production and negative environmental effects such as carbon emission to atmosphere, erosion and water pollution","crop management practices that can enhance carbon sequestration, sediment retention, nutrient retention",possibilities towards land use planning and crop land management options that has a potential to enhance food security while conserving biodiversity and maintaining environmental integrity in the region,ecosystem services;biodiversity;food security;crop production;environmental integrity,"This study examines the trade-offs and synergies between crop yield and ecosystem services (ES).

The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted Other AI Method tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riauâ€™s peatland as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/120384

In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content and stocks in the Casanare flooded savannas. We sampled 80 sites at two soil-depth intervals (0-10 and 10-30 cm), where SOC values ranged from 0.41% in the surface and 0.23% in the sub-surface of drier soils to over 14.50% and 7.51%, in soils that experienced seasonal flooding. Spatial predictions of SOC were done through two digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches: Expert-Knowledge (EK) and Random-Forest (RF). Although both approaches performed well, EK was slightly superior at predicting SOC. Covariates derived from vegetation cover, topography, and soil properties were identified as key drivers in controlling its distribution. Total SOC stocks were 55.07 Mt with a mean density of 83.1Â±24.3 tÂ·ha -1 in the first 30 cm of soil, with 12.3% of this located in areas that experience long periods of flooding (semi-seasonal savannas) , which represented only 7.9% of the study area (664,752 ha).

The Pastaza MaraÃ±Ã³n Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1â€“6%) and errors of omission (0â€“15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20â€“36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (<30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/115850

We assessed recent peat forest disturbances and their direct drivers from 2019 to 2021 in Cuvette Centrale, spanning the Republic of Congo (ROC) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Utilizing peatland maps and Radar for Detecting Deforestation alert data, we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of disturbances. Further, we examined 2267 randomly sampled peat forest disturbance events through visual interpretation of monthly Planet and Sentinel 2A data to identify direct drivers. Our findings revealed that between 2019 and 2021, about 91% of disturbances occurred in DRC, with hotspots concentrated in the northwest Sud-Ubangi district. Disturbances predominantly followed a sharp seasonal pattern, recurring during the first half of each year with temporal hotspots emerging between February and May, closely associated with smallholder agriculture activities. Smallholder agriculture accounted for over 88% of disturbances in Cuvette Centrale, representing a leading role both in ROC (similar to 77%) and DRC (similar to 89%). While small-scale logging contributed 7% to the disturbances in the region, it constituted an important driver (18%) in the ROC. Other drivers included floods, roads, and settlements. Approximately 77% of disturbances occurred outside managed forest concessions in Cuvette Centrale, with 40% extending into protected areas. About 90% of disturbances were concentrated within 1 km of peat forest edges and similar to 76% of the disturbances occurred within 5 km of road or river networks.

Its most representative land cover on peat is a Mauritia flexuosa dominated palm swamp (thereafter called dense PS), which has been under human pressure over decades due to the high demand for the M. flexuosa fruit often collected by cutting down the entire palm. Degradation of these carbon dense forests can substantially affect emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. The first objective of this research was to assess the impact of dense PS degradation on forest structure and biomass carbon stocks. The second one was to explore the potential of mapping the distribution of dense PS with different degradation levels using remote sensing data and methods. Biomass stocks were measured in 0.25 ha plots established in areas of dense PS with low (n = 2 plots), medium (n = 2) and high degradation (n = 4). We combined field and remote sensing data from the satellites Landsat TM and ALOS/PALSAR to discriminate between areas typifying dense PS with low, medium and high degradation and terra firme, restinga and mixed PS (not M. flexuosa dominated) forests. For this we used a Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. Results suggest a shift in forest composition from palm to woody tree dominated forest following degradation. We also found that human intervention in dense PS translates into significant reductions in tree carbon stocks with initial (above and below-ground) biomass stocks (135.4 Â± 4.8 Mg C haâˆ’1) decreased by 11 and 17% following medium and high degradation. The remote sensing analysis indicates a high separability between dense PS with low degradation from all other categories. Dense PS with medium and high degradation were highly separable from most categories except for restinga forests and mixed PS. Results also showed that data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors are important for the mapping of dense PS degradation. Overall land cover classification accuracy was high (91%). Results from this pilot analysis are encouraging to further explore the use of remote sensing data and methods for monitoring dense PS degradation at broader scales in the Peruvian Amazon. Providing precise estimates on the spatial extent of dense PS degradation and on biomass and peat derived emissions is required for assessing national emissions from forest degradation in Peru and is essential for supporting initiatives aiming at reducing degradation activities.",No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,https://hdl.handle.net/10568/80511

We built the largest fieldâ€based dataset on mangrove forest structure and biomass to date (c. 2,800 plots from 67 countries) to address macroecological questions pertaining to structural and functional diversity of mangroves spanning biogeographical and coastal morphology gradients. We used frequentist inference statistics and machine learning models to determine environmental drivers that control biomass allocation within and across mangrove communities globally. Allometric scaling relationships and forest structural complexity were consistent across biogeographical and coastal morphology gradients, suggesting that mangrove biomass is controlled by regional forcings rather than by latitude or species composition. For instance, nearly 40% of the global variation in biomass was explained by regional climate and hydroperiod, revealing nonlinear thresholds that control biomass accumulation across broad geographical gradients. Furthermore, we found that ecosystemâ€level carbon stocks (average 401 Â± 48 MgC/ha, covering biomass and the top 1 m of soil) varied little across diverse coastal morphologies, reflecting regional bottomâ€up geomorphic controls that shape global patterns in mangrove biomass apportioning.

Governments are increasingly holding the private sector responsible for their role in climate change impacts. Extreme weather events are incredibly costly for businesses. This is particularly true in agriculture, which relies heavily on favorable weather conditions. CSA practices and technologies are central to the transformative changes necessary to maintain the stabilityâ€”and profitabilityâ€”of the food system in the face of climate change. Where robust information on the benefits, costs, and risks of interventions is missing or incomplete, would-be investors, including donors, governments, businesses, and farmers, remain uninformed of the potentially massive dividends climate-smart investments could offer. This dearth of viable business models ultimately hinders the mainstreaming of productive, climate-resilient, low-emissions agriculture. Robust business-case analyses of CSA could accelerate the scaling of promising, profitable technologies by transparently and rigorously laying out the monetary and nonmonetary values of performance. We use existing data from Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA, previously known as The Compendium) to develop a general framework for establishing the business case for specific farm-level agricultural technologies. The framework focuses on the costs, benefits, and risks of adoption of CSA by smallholder farmers. We illustrate the application of the framework with two case studies in Kenya and Malawi to highlight opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned from building business cases for CSA.

Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term â€˜agronomic gainâ€™ based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety Ã— agronomic practice Ã— environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.",Variability of yields and its determinants in rice production systems,"Develop and introduce remote-sensing technology and/or mobile devices that can estimate KPIs (e.g., yield, soil health) and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs for indirect assessment.","Facilitate developing, evaluating, and scaling new innovations with proposed agronomic gain assessment to achieve their widespread adoption by different end users based on their needs and preferences.",rice;productivity;agriculture;Senegal;Africa,"This study presents a definition of agronomic gain and emphasizes the need for reliable assessment methods in various stages of agricultural practices.

We measured GHG fluxes from intact soil cores collected in Rakai, Uganda, an area characterized by lowâ€input smallholder (<2 ha) farming systems, typical for the East African highlands. The soil cores were air dried and rewetted to water holding capacities (WHCs) of 30, 55, and 80%. Soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured for 48 h following rewetting. Cumulative N2O fluxes were highest from soils under perennial crops and the lowest from soils under annual crops (P < 0.001 for all WHC). At WHC of 55% or 80%, the sandy clay loam soils had lower N2O fluxes than the clay soils (P < 0.001 and P = 0.041, respectively). Cumulative soil CO2 fluxes were highest from eucalyptus plantations and lowest from annual crops across multiple WHC (P = 0.014 at 30% WHC and P < 0.001 at both 55 and 80% WHC). Methane fluxes were below detectable limits, a shortcoming for using soil cores from the top soil.
